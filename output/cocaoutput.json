Some couple and partner routines are taught to keep in touch with the historic Appalachian clogging styles.The instructors teach both the steps and the routines. During classes the instructors cue or call all routines every time they are danced during the learning phase. This means once you know the steps at a given level, you can quickly join in with routines you have never seen.You will find you dance many and varied routines to pretty much all types of music, although country and top 100 current tunes are the most popular.Taps are a double jingle tap ordered from one of our suppliers. The sound of all the taps beating to the music, gets everybody tapping to the rhythms. In clogging the heel tap is used to give a strong regular beat during most steps.Like other worthwhile sporting activities, to progress quickly you may need to practice more than once a week at class.

The group focuses on music of Johann Sebastian Bach, his contemporaries, as well as pieces written before J. S. Bach was born with music written in the years 1600-1750.Performing on period-style instruments, the Bach Parley offers unique, exceptional concert experiences to educate and engage our community. We present Baroque music as it was performed hundreds of years ago with a fresh, accessible sound for today\u2019s audiences. The French word \u201cparley\u201d means discussion and a key element of Bach Parley concerts is the commentary provided by Music Director Valerie Arsenault who gives historical context about the composers and offers suggestions about what to listen for in the music.The Tallahassee Bach Parley is also the umbrella organization for a non-profit music school. In 2015, four teachers united to teach violin, viola, and cello at the Bach Parley String Academy at St. John\u2019s Episcopal church, and now the Academy has grown to six teachers, almost 100 students, and even offers ukulele classes.At all Sunday Tallahassee Bach Parley concerts this season, patrons will receive an insert in their programs with a discount coupon to use after the concert at participating downtown area restaurants. A $10 donation is suggested, and free childcare will be offered. The Bach Parley will hold their annual membership reception after the concert.For additional information about the Tallahassee Bach Parley, including the Bach Parley String Academy music school, visit www.bachparley.org.Enjoy the music, the venue, and the magic of Baroque performance with the Tallahassee Bach Parley!Don\u2019t miss our annual membership reception after the concert\u2026"},

This symbiotic relationship is not always widely appreciated, and is symptomatic of much more fundamental connections between science and art that extend into many arenas. Both science and art are driven by intuition and creativity, and both allow genius to express itself in the context of artificial or natural \u201crules\u201d. Understanding the physical nature of music illuminates the beauty of this creative process. Music, science and engineering are connected at many levels. I will use live keyboard demonstrations to illuminate how the origin of some musical styles, particularly blues piano, can be found in fundamental properties of sound and music. In particular, I will focus on the evolution of the scale and its impact on harmony and melody in western music.Murray Gibson became the Dean of the FAMU-FSU College of Engineering in 2016. \u00a0He grew up in the United Kingdom and holds a PhD in Physics from the University of Cambridge.

Bach was born with music written in the years 1600-1750.Performing on period-style instruments, the Bach Parley offers unique, exceptional concert experiences to educate and engage our community. We present Baroque music as it was performed hundreds of years ago with a fresh, accessible sound for today\u2019s audiences. The French word \u201cparley\u201d means discussion and a key element of Bach Parley concerts is the commentary provided by Music Director Valerie Arsenault who gives historical context about the composers and offers suggestions about what to listen for in the music.The Tallahassee Bach Parley is also the umbrella organization for a non-profit music school. In 2015, four teachers united to teach violin, viola, and cello at the Bach Parley String Academy at St. John\u2019s Episcopal church, and now the Academy has grown to six teachers, almost 100 students, and even offers ukulele classes.At all Sunday Tallahassee Bach Parley concerts this season, patrons will receive an insert in their programs with a discount coupon to use after the concert at participating downtown area restaurants. A $10 donation is suggested, and free childcare will be offered. The Bach Parley will hold their annual membership reception after the concert.For additional information about the Tallahassee Bach Parley, including the Bach Parley String Academy music school, visit www.bachparley.org.Enjoy the music, the venue, and the magic of Baroque performance with the Tallahassee Bach Parley!"},
