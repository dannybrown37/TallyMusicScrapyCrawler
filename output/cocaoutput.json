Four years later, Alix Dobkin released \u201cLavender Jane Loves Women,\u201d the first record produced, engineered and played by women. A myriad of musicians joined them, from acappella group Sweet Honey in the Rock, to singer-songwriter Cris Williamson, to activist/singer Holly Near, to jazz/gospel musician Mary Watkins and many more; collectively they have sold millions of albums. Venues, radio shows, record distributors, media, labels and sound technicians sprung up to host and work with these performers. Fans traveled miles to attend performances. These women set out to create something different than what was present in mainstream music. They created artist-run independent record labels and organized music festivals that drew thousands. Before Lilith Fair and riot grrrls, there was women\u2019s music!"},

The Bach Parley is made up of experienced musicians who are trained in historically informed performance, mainly local professional performers and teachers, and FSU faculty and students. Many Bach Parley musicians also perform in Baroque music groups around the country, such as in Atlanta, New York, Texas, and Boston.The word \u201cparley\u201d in French means discussion and a key element of Tallahassee Bach Parley concerts is the commentary offered by our music director to engage and enlighten our audience. These dialogues give the audience a historical background about the composers and their world and suggest what to listen for in the music. This entertaining and light-hearted educational commentary connects the audience with what the musicians are playing, lifts barriers between performers and listeners, and creates a relaxed concert atmosphere with an informed and engaged audience.Other programs include \u201cKids Go For B\u2019roque,\u201d a competition and honors concert featuring talented young musicians from the community performing the music of the Baroque period.

This recreates for our audiences the experience of hearing and seeing Baroque music as it may have been originally performed hundreds of years ago while generating a fresh sound immediately accessible to listeners today. The Bach Parley is made up of experienced musicians who are trained in historically informed performance, mainly local professional performers and teachers, and FSU faculty and students. Many Bach Parley musicians also perform in Baroque music groups around the country, such as in Atlanta, New York, Texas, and Boston.The word \u201cparley\u201d in French means discussion and a key element of Tallahassee Bach Parley concerts is the commentary offered by our music director to engage and enlighten our audience. These dialogues give the audience a historical background about the composers and their world and suggest what to listen for in the music. This entertaining and light-hearted educational commentary connects the audience with what the musicians are playing, lifts barriers between performers and listeners, and creates a relaxed concert atmosphere with an informed and engaged audience.Other programs include \u201cKids Go For B\u2019roque,\u201d a competition and honors concert featuring talented young musicians from the community performing the music of the Baroque period. We also run the Bach Parley String Academy and offer lessons on violin, viola, and cello as well as ukulele classes."},

I deeply believe the application of these sacred sounds and vibrations can open us up for alignment to life force flow. Time and time again, I have experienced the positive effects that sound healing brings. My path is to share the medicine of sound with you so that you can apply it to your own path of personal development. Restoring ourselves enables us to bring greater love and light into all we do, and to realize our highest potential.
