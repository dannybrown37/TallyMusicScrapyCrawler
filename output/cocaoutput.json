By imitating other instruments or even animals\u00a0this extravagantly eccentric piece is like an early version of Mussorgsky\u2019s \u201cPictures at an Exhibition\u201d because the stringed instruments evoke a variety of images and sounds familiar to 17th century life. The centerpiece of the concert with the Bach Parley Chamber Singers is J. S. Bach\u2019s Cantata No. 4, \u201cChrist lag in Todesbanden\u201d \u2013 \u201cChrist lay in death\u2019s bonds\u201d \u2013 a beloved cantata for Easter. To introduce the cantata the musicians will trace the cantata\u2019s main hymn, written by Martin Luther in 1524, from its origins in plainsong chant through brief examples from other composers who used this melody before Bach. The grand finale of the concert will be \u201cLift Up your Heads\u201d a joyful chorus from the second part of Handel\u2019s Messiah.This is music director Valerie Arsenault\u2019s 11th year leading the Bach Parley. The Bach\u00a0Parley performs primarily on period instruments \u2013 harpsichord and baroque style\u00a0stringed\u00a0instruments with gut strings, and occasionally includes baroque\u00a0vocalists as on this concert. The French word \u201cparley\u201d means discussion, and a\u00a0key element of Bach Parley concerts is the commentary\u00a0provided by Arsenault who gives historical context about the composers and\u00a0offers suggestions about what to listen for in the music.The Tallahassee Bach Parley is also\u00a0the umbrella organization for a non-profit music school, The Bach Parley\u00a0String Academy, now in its fourth year offering violin, viola, and cello\u00a0lessons along with ukulele classes at St. John\u2019s\u00a0Episcopal church.The concert will be at 3PM on Sunday, June 2 at St. John\u2019s Episcopal Church, 211 North Monroe Street, and the Bach Parley\u2019s annual membership reception will be held after the performance.

Your legs will tone up very quickly. Clogging improves flexibility, coordination, endurance and strength. It increases lung capacity, relieves stress, and it\u2019s aerobic and burns fat. Clogging is usually danced in lines because there is a better social group feeling when you can see that your new friends are dancing the same routines as you. Some couple and partner routines are taught to keep in touch with the historic Appalachian clogging styles.The instructors teach both the steps and the routines. During classes the instructors cue or call all routines every time they are danced during the learning phase. This means once you know the steps at a given level, you can quickly join in with routines you have never seen.You will find you dance many and varied routines to pretty much all types of music, although country and top 100 current tunes are the most popular.Taps are a double jingle tap ordered from one of our suppliers. The sound of all the taps beating to the music, gets everybody tapping to the rhythms.

His first instrument was a dulcimer his father built. Then came drums at age 13, and guitar at 16. Having a career in music has always been his dream, and he\u2019s been making it a reality for the past few years, touring the country and releasing his debut album earlier this year called \u201cDifferent Faces.\u201dMore about Backstage Pass\nBackstage Pass grew out of the Concerts in the Park series begun in 1986, by Florida First Federal and late community leader, Roger Schadd. From 1986 to 2008, free outdoor concerts were held every summer featuring local bands. In order to keep the series going during the recession, Backstage Pass began welcoming guests through the Backstage Door of the Marina Civic Center in 2009, and the first band was \u201cOn Call\u201d, led by the late Hulon Crayton. Tickets were $5 (and they still are) and the community embraced it from the first downbeat. We are so grateful to continue this wonderful tradition."},

His first instrument was a dulcimer his father built. Then came drums at age 13, and guitar at 16. Having a career in music has always been his dream, and he\u2019s been making it a reality for the past few years, touring the country and releasing his debut album earlier this year called \u201cDifferent Faces.\u201dMore about Backstage Pass\nBackstage Pass grew out of the Concerts in the Park series begun in 1986, by Florida First Federal and late community leader, Roger Schadd. From 1986 to 2008, free outdoor concerts were held every summer featuring local bands. In order to keep the series going during the recession, Backstage Pass began welcoming guests through the Backstage Door of the Marina Civic Center in 2009, and the first band was \u201cOn Call\u201d, led by the late Hulon Crayton. Tickets were $5 (and they still are) and the community embraced it from the first downbeat. We are so grateful to continue this wonderful tradition."},
