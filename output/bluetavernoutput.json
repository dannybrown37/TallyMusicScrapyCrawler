There will be a White Elephant* gift exchange from 7-7:30, then we'll just keep playing until everyone gets tired & goes home -- or around 10 pm, whichever comes first!* A White Elephant Gift Exchange is a popular Christmas event where people vie to walk away with the best present. It also goes by \"Dirty Santa\" and other names. The White Elephant game is played by a lot of different rulesets  some dead simple and others confusingly elaborate. Here are the basic rules:1. Each player brings one wrapped gift to contribute to a common pool (value of $5 or less suggested)2. Players draw numbers to determine what order they will go in3. Players sit in a circle where they can see the gift pile4. The first player selects a gift from the pool and opens it where everyone can see it5. The following players can choose to either pick an unwrapped gift from the pool or steal a previous players gift. Anyone who gets their gift stolen in this way can do the same  choose a new gift or steal from someone else.6. After all players have had a turn, the first player gets a chance to swap the gift he or she is holding for any other opened gift. Anyone whose gift is stolen may steal from someone else (as long as that person hasnt been stolen from yet). When someone declines to steal a gift, the game comes to an end.", "venue": "Blue Tavern", "venue_website": "http://www.bluetaverntallahassee.com/", "time": "5:00 PM", "date": "2018-12-26", "headliner": "Boxing Day Party", "price": "FEE:  $0"},
