    "notes": "motown, r&b\n\nThe history of The Temptations is the history of contemporary American pop. An essential component of the original Motown machine—that amazing engine invented by Berry Gordy—The Temps began their musical life in Detroit in the early sixties. It wasn’t until 1964, however, that the Smokey Robinson written-and-produced “The Way You Do the Things You Do” turned the guys into stars.An avalanche of hits followed, many of which…”My Girl,” for instance…attained immortality. “It’s Growing,” “Since I Lost My Baby,” “Get Ready,” “Ain’t Too Proud to Beg,” “Beauty Is only Skin Deep,” “I Wish It Would Rain”…the hits kept coming. The Temptations were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1989 and received a Grammy® Lifetime Achievement Award in 2013.Originally called the Four Aims, the Four Tops made their first single for Chess in 1956, and spent seven years on the road and in nightclubs, singing pop, blues, Broadway, but mostly jazz—four-part harmony jazz.Their first Motown hit, “Baby I Need Your Loving” in 1964, made them stars and their sixties track record on the label is indispensable to any retrospective of the decade. Their songs, soulful and bittersweet, were across-the-board successes. “I Can’t Help Myself (Sugar Pie, Honey Bunch),” a No. 1 R&B and Pop smash in 1965, is one of Motown’s longest-running chart toppers. Their commercial peak was highlighted by a romantic trilogy: the No. 1 “Reach Out I’ll Be There,” “Standing In The Shadows Of Love” (No. 2 R&B/no. 6 pop) and “Bernadette” (No. 3 R&B/No. 4 pop).With 24 Top 40 pop hits to their credit, the Four Tops were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall Of Fame in 1990.Previous Event Next Event",

The Tallahassee Democrat might put it best: “The PRISM shows are built on a more-is-more philosophy…PRISM’s contrast between traditional fare and more experimental groups may be one of the reasons behind the program’s success. Its multifaceted nature makes PRISM a gem among music lovers. Because of its design, [the performance] offers a unique show depending on where an audience member sits – those in the balcony will be nearer to certain ensembles than those in other sections, and vice versa.” So come experience this unique event that lauds our students and faculty. It’s fantastic, fresh, and not to be missed!Previous Event Next Event",

    "notes": "dance, flamenco\n\nFarruquito (Juan Manuel Fernández Montoya), heir to the most renowned Gypsy flamenco dynasty, was immersed in the purest form of flamenco, founded by his grandfather, “El Farruco,” one of the greatest dancers in the history of flamenco. In 2015, Farruquito was invited to dance with the LA Phil, in four sold-out gala concerts of an adapted version of Amor Brujo directed by Gustavo Dudamel at the Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles. Farruquito returned to the United Stated for a coast-to-coast tour in 2016 and was hailed by The New York Times as the, “greatest flamenco dancer of his century.”He has made it his life’s mission to share the purest form of flamenco on stages all around the world while further broadening his influence by collaborating with the most influential artists of our time. From birth his first appearance on stage was on Broadway at 4 years of age with his grandfather in the hit Flamenco Puro. At 11, he was featured in the film Flamenco, which launched his career and positioned him amongst the most elite flamenco artists of the world. He created his first show, Raíces Flamencas (Flamenco Roots) at 15, which demonstrated his mastery as a dancer and gave him the opportunity to showcase the traditions of his prodigious flamenco line.Previous Event Next Event",

This Ukrainian “ethno chaos” band was created in 2004 at the Kiiv Center of Contemporary Art “DAKH” by the avant-garde theatre director Vladyslav Troitskyi.DakhaBrakha means “give/take” in the old Ukrainian language. Theatre work has left its mark on the band performances as their shows are always staged with a strong visual element.After experimenting with Ukrainian folk music, the band has added rhythms of the surrounding world into their music, thus creating the bright, unique and unforgettable sound of DakhaBrakha. Accompanied by Indian, Arabic, African and Russian traditional instrumentation, the quartet’s astonishingly powerful and uncompromising vocal range creates a trans-national sound rooted in Ukrainian culture. At the crossroads of Ukrainian folklore and theatre, their musical spectrum is at first intimate then riotous, plumbing the depths of contemporary roots and rhythms, inspiring “cultural and artistic liberation.”Previous Event Next Event",

His curiosity took him to southern Spain in search of flamenco roots and to South America, exploring various musical styles of Latin jazz. Developing an interest in Swing, he began composing Swing materials that he has combined with Latin music.Daniel’s unique guitar style has made him a landmark musician in Germany’s Jazz scene. His sound encompasses jazz, pop and classical music. He began playing classical guitar at the age of 8 and was soon introduced to jazz, rock and pop music.
