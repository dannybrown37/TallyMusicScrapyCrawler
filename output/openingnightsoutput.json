But then, you remember her songs and her playing. And it hits you: brash, beautiful originality is exactly what Molly is doing.The 2017 release of her debut EP Rise further introduced Molly to a roots music audience who had already enthusiastically embraced and elevated her. Her 2017 and 2018 wins for Guitar Player of the Year from the International Bluegrass Association (IBMA) were history-making, as the first woman to be nominated for the honor, and the accolades have kept coming in 2018 with Folk Alliance International\u00a0awarding her\u00a0\u201c\u00a0Song of the Year\u201d for\u00a0\u201cYou Didn\u2019t Call My Name\u201d during the\u00a0International Folk Music Awards.

In between tours, she has been hard at work in the studio crafting her eagerly-anticipated debut album with producer/engineer Ryan Hewitt (Avett Brothers, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Lumineers), which will be released in early 2019 on Compass Records.Previous Event Next Event", "venue": "Richard G.
