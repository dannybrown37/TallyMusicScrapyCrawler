Recording in cars, bedrooms, and other solitary spaces, Toledo self-released 10 Car Seat Headrest records during his college years on the music platform Bandcamp. In 2015, after signing with Matador Records, Car Seat Headrest expanded to include Andrew Katz on drums, Ethan Ives on guitar, and Seth Dalby on bass. The four-piece toured and recorded as a band, releasing the acclaimed Teens of Denial in 2016 and a re-recorded, re-imagined version of their 2011 classic album, Twin Fantasy, in 2018. The lineup has expanded again in 2018, combining with fellow touring act Naked Giants to perform Twin Fantasy as a seven-piece ensemble. The music of Car Seat Headrest traverses various genres under the \"indie\" label, including lo-fi, electronic, and pop rock. With the exception of Teens of Denial, produced by 90s legend Steve Fisk, all Car Seat Headrest records have been produced by Toledo. Toledo's work is notable for its large online cult following, and the group has received attention from publications including Pitchfork, Rolling Stone, The New Yorker, and Paste, amongst others.",

GP is $22. 18+\n\nNoname (born Fatimah Warner) is an American artist from Chicago, Illinois, who blurs the lines of poetry and rap through the music she creates. Noname grew up in Bronzeville, a historic neighborhood on the southside of Chicago that famously attracted accomplished black artists and intellectuals of all types. Noname first discovered her love for words while taking a creative writing class as a sophmore in highschool. On July 31st Noname released her debut project entitled Telefone which was 3 years in the making and highly anticipated by fans and media alike. Instantly the project gained critical acclaim with a rave review by Pitchfork and landing her praise from major outlets like Rolling Stones, Complex and Dazed & Confused. Noname has been hailed by The FADER, Complex, and Rolling Stone as one of the most exciting and important new artists of 2016. Thanks to Telefone’s success, Noname played some shows in support of Ms. Lauryn Hill, who hand-picked Noname to open for her on tour. When first approaching the project, Noname set out to emulate the feeling of talking on the phone with someone for the first time. She describes Telefone as “an introductory conversation with someone you’re interested in”. But as Noname continued to work on the tape, it also transitioned a bit into mortality: the idea of life and death and the duality between those two things.",

GP is $25. 18+\n\nMitski Miyawaki has always been wary of being turned a symbol, knowing we’re quick to put women on pedestals and even quicker to knock them down. Nonetheless, after the breakout success of 2016’s Puberty 2, she was hailed as the new vanguard of indie rock, the one who would save the genre from the white dudes who’ve historically dominated it. Her carefully crafted songs have often been portrayed as emotionally raw, overflowing confessionals from a fevered chosen girl, but in her fifth album, Be The Cowboy, Mitski introduces a persona who has been teased but never so fully present until now—a woman in control. “It’s not like it just pours out,” she says about her songwriting, “it’s not like I’m a vessel. For this new record, I experimented in narrative and fiction.” Though she hesitates to go so far as to say she created full-on characters, she reveals she had in mind “a very controlled icy repressed woman who is starting to unravel. Because women have so little power and showing emotion is seen as weakness, this ‘character’ clings to any amount of control she can get. Still, there is something very primordial in her that is trying to find a way to get out.”",
