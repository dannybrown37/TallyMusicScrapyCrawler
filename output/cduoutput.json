Recording in cars, bedrooms, and other solitary spaces, Toledo self-released 10 Car Seat Headrest records during his college years on the music platform Bandcamp. In 2015, after signing with Matador Records, Car Seat Headrest expanded to include Andrew Katz on drums, Ethan Ives on guitar, and Seth Dalby on bass. The four-piece toured and recorded as a band, releasing the acclaimed Teens of Denial in 2016 and a re-recorded, re-imagined version of their 2011 classic album, Twin Fantasy, in 2018. The lineup has expanded again in 2018, combining with fellow touring act Naked Giants to perform Twin Fantasy as a seven-piece ensemble. The music of Car Seat Headrest traverses various genres under the \"indie\" label, including lo-fi, electronic, and pop rock. With the exception of Teens of Denial, produced by 90s legend Steve Fisk, all Car Seat Headrest records have been produced by Toledo. Toledo's work is notable for its large online cult following, and the group has received attention from publications including Pitchfork, Rolling Stone, The New Yorker, and Paste, amongst others.", "venue": "the moon", "time": "7:00pm", "date": "2019-02-21", "headliner": "Car Seat Headrest"},

Bassist Jacob Theriot and guitarist Christian Theriot are brothers, forming the core trio with friend and vocalist Cale Chronister. Their '80s-influenced breezy indie pop sound informed much of their debut LP, Naked All the Time, which was recorded at Blackwatch Studio in Norman, Oklahoma, and released in late 2015.

While still living in Boston, Medford had been recording and performing as a solo artist under the moniker Ian, an old high school nickname bestowed upon her by her skater friends. A last minute cancellation by a touring drummer in 2014 led her to work with Tim Cheney, with whom she quickly forged a creative connection and burgeoning friendship. By the time she recruited bassist Damien Scalise, the project had evolved from a solo endeavor to a trio, and they adopted the new name Ian Sweet. Musically complex, yet undeniably hooky, Medford's songs confronted themes of anxiety and panic with bright-toned guitar pop and references to Nickelodeon's Slime Time Live, Michael Jordan, and skateboarding. After settling in Brooklyn, the group signed with Hardly Art and released their self-titled debut EP in the summer of 2016. It was followed a few months later by Shapeshifter, their full-length debut.", "venue": "The Wilbury", "time": "8:30pm", "date": "2018-11-12", "headliner": "IAN SWEET"},

GP is $22. 18+\n\nNoname (born Fatimah Warner) is an American artist from Chicago, Illinois, who blurs the lines of poetry and rap through the music she creates. Noname grew up in Bronzeville, a historic neighborhood on the southside of Chicago that famously attracted accomplished black artists and intellectuals of all types. Noname first discovered her love for words while taking a creative writing class as a sophmore in highschool. On July 31st Noname released her debut project entitled Telefone which was 3 years in the making and highly anticipated by fans and media alike. Instantly the project gained critical acclaim with a rave review by Pitchfork and landing her praise from major outlets like Rolling Stones, Complex and Dazed & Confused. Noname has been hailed by The FADER, Complex, and Rolling Stone as one of the most exciting and important new artists of 2016. Thanks to Telefone\u2019s success, Noname played some shows in support of Ms. Lauryn Hill, who hand-picked Noname to open for her on tour. When first approaching the project, Noname set out to emulate the feeling of talking on the phone with someone for the first time. She describes Telefone as \u201can introductory conversation with someone you\u2019re interested in\u201d. But as Noname continued to work on the tape, it also transitioned a bit into mortality: the idea of life and death and the duality between those two things.", "venue": "The Moon", "time": "7:00pm", "date": "2019-01-19", "headliner": "Noname"}
