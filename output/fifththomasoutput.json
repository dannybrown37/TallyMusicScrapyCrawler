In October 1985 Drivin N Cryin played their first show at Atlanta\u2019s famed 688 Club. The band quickly gained attention for their blistering live shows, and amassed a rabid fanbase in the fertile soil of the late-1980s Southeast music scene. Now, 33 years later, and after releasing four full length albums on Island Records and one on Geffen Records, founding members Kevn Kinney and Tim Nielsen find themselves enjoying a milestone anniversary for the band, having survived the pressures of fame, a shifting musical landscape, multiple lineup changes, and miles of back roads and highways to arrive here. With a gold record, 10 full-length albums, and a handful of EPs to their credit, the band still refuses to rest. In 2012, a documentary about the band, entitled Scarred but Smarter: Life n Times of Drivin\u2019 N\u2019 Cryin\u2019, was produced. In 2015, a collection of 10 choice cuts from the band\u2019s 4-EP \u201cSongs\u201d series, entitled Best of Songs, was released on Nashville\u2019s Plowboy Records. Additionally, the band was inducted into the Georgia Music Hall of Fame that same year. The following year, Drivin N Cryin released a vinyl-only album, entitled Archives Vol One, with a collection of basement recordings from the years 1988 to 1990. With Dave V. Johnson as their drummer, and the band\u2019s newest member, Laur Joamets, (originally Sturgill Simpson) now being added to the lineup, Drivin N Cryin continues to tour the U.S. to great acclaim.More about the band:\nWebsite\u00a0|\u00a0YouTube\u00a0|\u00a0Facebook\u00a0|\u00a0Instagram\u00a0|\u00a0Twitter\u00a0|\u00a0Spotify\u00a0Whiskey in the Pines\u2019 unmistakably Southern moniker\u2014a perfect fit for its brand of heartfelt, no-frills Americana\u2014was inspired by their frequent excursions down US-319 south to the languid shores of the Gulf. The band\u2019s Florida roots imbue their alt-country songs with a gentle warmth and sense of connectedness. This is heartland rock & roll, shot through with ambling, country-tinged flourishes. There are songs that would perfectly score a backyard day-drinking session, and others that work as peaceful codas to soundtrack the after-party cleanup.\u00a0As seen on stage with: Lucero, John Moreland, American Aquarium, Plane White T\u2019s, Sister Hazel, Roadkill Ghost Choir, Shane Smith and the Saints, Jason Eady.More about the band:\nWebsite\u00a0|\u00a0Facebook\u00a0|\u00a0Instagram\u00a0|\u00a0Spotify"},

And while that has proven to be the case, every path has it\u2019s unexpected turns.At 18 years old, Will sold everything he owned and took out a loan to buy recording equipment to fully realize the music he had been writing on his guitar. Locking himself away for months at a time he honed his skills as a producer, songwriter, singer. By the time Will got everything he wanted in the form of a record contract from his all time musical idol, he walked away from it all feeling like he wasn\u2019t making the music he wanted to.After being haunted by the love he tried to leave behind, he knew it was time to return to his lifelong family calling in writing and recording songs. In 2015, Will Thompson recorded and released his new album \u2018Turn it Up\u2019, a mix of rock country anthems that showcases stadium-ready songwriting and soulful production at every turn.

With the addition in 2015 of experimental guitar icon Nels Cline (who belatedly became a pop-guitar icon by joining Wilco) the trio\u2019s lineup was complete.NELS CLINE might be as close as the modern avant-garde gets to a household name. Before joining indie rock institution Wilco in 2004, Cline divided his energy between improvised contexts alongside Julius Hemphill, Vinny Golia, and brother Alex, and more song-oriented settings like Carla Bozulich\u2019s alt-country outfit Geraldine Fibbers and Mike Watt\u2019s Crew of the Flying Saucer. Cline continues to occupy the narrow space between pure sound and song, as exemplified by his longstanding Singers trio with drummer Scott Amendola and bassist Trevor Dunn, and his recent duo with guitar prodigy Julian Lage.\u00a0www.nelscline.comIn his own words, Detroit-bred, New York-based GERALD CLEAVER\u2019s multifaceted approach to the drum set balances \u201cstatic sound and extreme dynamics, melodicism within heavy texture, deep-rooted groove, unchained abandon, and the power and revelation of recurring form.\u201d Cleaver made a name for himself through enduring partnerships with Vision Fest regulars like Roscoe Mitchell and Charles Gayle, but lately critics have been abuzz about his new musique concr\u00e8te-cum-free rock quintet Black Host with Darius Jones, Cooper-Moore, Brandon Seabrook, and Pascal Niggenkemper. Pitchfork\u2019s Hank Shteamer described 2013\u2019s Life in the Sugar Candle Mines as, \u201ca well-tended hot-house: feverish and bracingly weird, yet also purposeful and shrewdly strategic.\u201dLARRY OCHS is best known as a founder of the Rova Sax Quartet, a San Francisco institution that pioneered the application of improvisational strategies within the context of contemporary composition, beginning in the late 1970s and continuing right up to the present day: 40 years old in 2018. Equally inspired by modernist 20th century composition and the more worldly, abrasive strands of 60s free jazz, Rova and Ochs became widely celebrated for the lengths they would go to stretch the performance parameters of notated music through early collaborations with Henry Kaiser, Fred Frith, and John Zorn. Ochs connection with Cline began in the late 1990\u2019s and culminated with the Celestial Septet, a septet comprised of both the Rova Sax Quartet and the Nels Cline Singers, with a fantastic CD release including a long, ecstatic Ochs composition and tours from 2009 \u2013 2011. Ochs and Cleaver have performed off and on as a duo since 2013; a duo CD release (coming in 2018) \u2013 a beautiful , haunting set of music called \u201cSongs of the Wild Cave\u201d \u2013 will document their 2016 live recording made inside a secret cave in the Dordogne area of France; a cave that contains upwards of 150 Pleistocene-era paintings.
