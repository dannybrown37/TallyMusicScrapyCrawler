The band, who originally cut their teeth playing the oyster bars and listening rooms of the Florida Panhandle, has since written and released two full-length albums: their studio debut Follow (2014), called \u201ceye-opening, but warmly familiar\u201d by Earmilk, and whose title track is \u201cone of the most beautiful pieces of music I\u2019ve ever heard\u201d (Todd Moe of NCPR); and sophomore effort West of Here (2016), with its \u201ctight-as-a-rubber-band\u201d harmonies and \u201cinfectious\u201d songwriting (PopMatters).For their third album, This Side of the Glass (2019), The Currys teamed up with producer/guitarist Sam Whedon and engineer Stewart Myers (Jason Mraz, Parachute) to map new terrain. As ever, the band\u2019s three-part family harmonies provide the organic, lived-in feel of roots music, but the album aspires to a greater variety of tone, form, and orchestration than earlier releases. The songs defy categorization into any one genre: the country nostalgia of \u201cGulf Coast Home\u201d complements the folk-pop sensibility of \u201cPin You Down,\u201d while the guitars and gang vocals of \u201cSoon Enough\u201d pay unmistakable homage to Paul Simon\u2019s \u201cGraceland.\u201dLyrically, This Side of the Glass explores questions of perspective, an apt consideration for a band featuring three songwriters. Each Curry offers his take on the time-worn threads of life and love, contributing to the album\u2019s tapestry of introspection and social commentary. Likewise, each in turn ruminates on the paradox faced by every performing songwriter: how to balance one\u2019s roles as both the author of stories and the object of storytelling. This Side of the Glass is an insightful and satisfying new chapter from a band with many more stories to tell.The Currys kick off the This Side of the Glass tour in early March, joined by Whedon on guitar and supported by Sebastian Green (drums) and Alex Rees (keys, organ).Our kitchen will also be open for the evening from 6pm until 9:30pm, giving you plenty of time to enjoy a delicious meal during the show!This night will be packed, so grab a ticket before they\u2019re gone!

Honest and careworn, Jeremy\u2019s voice can touch on wry, jubilant, and debauched \u2013 all in a single line. Ties of Blood and Affection offers a fair dose resolution to Jeremy\u2019s story.

With a sound that Paste Magazine likens to the \u201cfreak-outs of My Morning Jacket with the Muscle Shoals-inspired Leslie speakers and The Band\u2019s narrative storytelling\u201d, The Trongone Band is turning heads and making an impact on the Southern Rock \u2018n\u2019 Soul and Americana scenes.Formed by brothers Andrew and Johnny Trongone with father John Sr on bass, The Trongone Band (tron-GO-knee) has grown from a family affair to a full on touring machine with the addition of keyboardist Ben \u201cWolfe\u201d White and bassist Chip Hale. In the words of Live for Live Music, \u201cthe quartet has come together to create an old-school and all-in-the-family sound reminiscent of The Allman Brothers while still keeping it fresh with their cutting edge original compositions that also infuse funk and blues into the mix.\u201dKeeping with the homegrown vibe, the band nestled into the woods outside of RVA, tapping into Montrose Recording\u2019s Flickinger console, one of only seven remaining in the world. Known as the console that revolutionized the recording industry in the 60s & 70s, the Flickinger provided the warm sounds that turned into \u201cKeys to the House\u201d and brought to life what MusicFestNews described as \u201cimagery of boxcar drifters, rolling hills and dirt roads that are easy to close your eyes and get lost in\u201d.Summer and Fall of 2017 saw The Trongone Band taking \u201cKeys to the House\u201d on the road while touring in support of stalwarts including Umphrey\u2019s McGee, Reckless Kelly, American Aquarium and Cris Jacobs.

It was a welcome new voice in a genre too often mired in the staid and conventional. And while that record may have come to many as a surprise,\u00a0Years\u00a0solidifies the point: Sarah Shook & the Disarmers have moved from getting people\u2019s attention to commanding it. The album\u2013with its\u00a0sharpened songwriting, unique perspective, deepened sound and roll-up-your-sleeves attitude\u2013will grab you by the collar and put a defiant finger to your chest. It is resolute, blunt, and unflinching.Inspired by artists such as the Sex Pistols, Elliott Smith and Hank Williams, Sarah sings with confidence, control, and, at times, a hint of menace.\u00a0The Disarmers match her on every track, coloring the tales of resilience and empathy with as much urgency as ever as well as a broader sonic sweep.\u00a0It\u2019s easy to hear Sarah as a close cousin to artists like\u00a0Hurray for the Riff Raff\u00a0and\u00a0Margo Price\u00a0on the title track, or in the country-\u201860s mod vibe on \u201cLesson.\u201d \u201cGood as Gold,\u201d sporting a kiss-off line for the ages,\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re as good as gold/ I\u2019m as good as gone,\u201d\u00a0is\u00a0both vulnerable and defiant, soaring with pop-inflected harmonies.\u00a0And with an expansiveness evoking the wide-open West, \u201cWhat it Takes\u201d speaks to the truth of the record, to her life, and to the universe.At its pounding heart,\u00a0Years\u00a0crackles with a pointedly contemporary and relevant take on the outlaw spirit.

But she knew there were songs, and they had to get out. Six even years since her critically acclaimed Welder, as well as much personal tumult, there were songs that needed to be born.For fans of the Florida-born\u2019n\u2019raised Cook, a Grand Ole Opry regular, SiriusXM Outlaw Country hostess and David Letterman favorite,\u00a0Exodus of Venus\u00a0will be something of a shock. If she maintains the tang of her drawl, what emerges \u2013 beyond Cook\u2019s always vibrant and vivid sense of detail \u2013 is a song cycle soaked in turpentine, musk and honey.Make sure you don\u2019t miss her long awaited return to our Mainstage on Friday, January 25th!Learn More About the Artist:ELIZABETH COOK: Official Website\u00a0|\u00a0Facebook\u00a0|\u00a0Soundcloud\u00a0|\u00a0Instagram\u00a0|\u00a0TwitterWADE SAPP (solo/acoustic):\u00a0Official Website | Facebook\u00a0|\u00a0Soundcloud\u00a0|\u00a0Instagram\u00a0|\u00a0Twitter"},

The release of the debut single \u201cHole in One\u201d solidified him as an authentic indie-blues artist, earning a loyal underground following. He continued to study the roots of blues and soul music, reinventing his style and reemerging as N.W. Izzard.In 2015, N.W. reconnected with hometown friend Tyler Watts, who was on the tail end of producing an adventure travel documentary, where Izzard was a featured artist on the soundtrack. Sharing a common vision, they began exchanging original songs and ideas while listening to their favorite blues records. In a few days time, songs like Howlin\u2019 Out, Sun\u2019s Gonna Shine and Down to Ride were born. Izzard introduced Watts to the art of busking, performing in the streets of North Central Florida before moving aboard Tyler\u2019s 46\u2019 sailboat and relocating to the Florida Keys. The duo spent the remainder of 2015 writing songs, playing the streets and refining their sound.During that time, another childhood friend, Nathan Ranew, saw the N.W. Izzard duo performing at a music festival and convinced the boys to move to Jax Beach, where there was more opportunities for original music. In 2016, they \u201chit the ground running\u201d earning residencies at Lynch\u2019s Irish Pub and other local venues, playing memorable performances at the infamous Freebird Live and continuing to build their cult-like following. Upon the release of their debut album \u201cNo Sleep\u201d, the band was evolving from a 2 piece into a power trio as Nate transitioned from manger to bass player, and from local stand outs to regional touring artists. The new addition brought forward a new sound and subsequently a new name, The Honey Hounds were born.Following the 2017 release of their EP \u201cMidnight Magic\u201d, the Honey Hounds continue to reenergize western music, embodying the rock n roll lifestyle while embracing the roots of soul and funk. Balancing between righteousness and the mysticism that surrounds the blues culture, they\u2019ve come to represent the resurgence of a genre and the voice of a generation.Currently the boys are touring and playing festivals though out the U.S. and preparing to record their next album.Learn More About the Artist:HONEY HOUNDS: Official Website |\u00a0Facebook\u00a0| Instagram | Spotify"},
