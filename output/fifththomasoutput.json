He visits their compositions by putting his original vocabulary and sound into the harmonic structure of the songs.Bobby brings a unique sound to his performance because he plays through a combination of Leslie cabinet and vintage guitar amp which gives him the beautiful sound of an organ and guitar together. A stellar songwriter, vocalist and guitarist he fuses rock, funk, jazz and blues into a magical musical tapestry. He has performed with such great artists as Vassar Clements, Warren Haynes, Widespread Panic, George Porter Jr. and the list goes on and on. His new CD, BLR was just release to rave reviews.

It was a welcome new voice in a genre too often mired in the staid and conventional. And while that record may have come to many as a surprise,\u00a0Years\u00a0solidifies the point: Sarah Shook & the Disarmers have moved from getting people\u2019s attention to commanding it. The album\u2013with its\u00a0sharpened songwriting, unique perspective, deepened sound and roll-up-your-sleeves attitude\u2013will grab you by the collar and put a defiant finger to your chest. It is resolute, blunt, and unflinching.Inspired by artists such as the Sex Pistols, Elliott Smith and Hank Williams, Sarah sings with confidence, control, and, at times, a hint of menace.\u00a0The Disarmers match her on every track, coloring the tales of resilience and empathy with as much urgency as ever as well as a broader sonic sweep.\u00a0It\u2019s easy to hear Sarah as a close cousin to artists like\u00a0Hurray for the Riff Raff\u00a0and\u00a0Margo Price\u00a0on the title track, or in the country-\u201860s mod vibe on \u201cLesson.\u201d \u201cGood as Gold,\u201d sporting a kiss-off line for the ages,\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re as good as gold/ I\u2019m as good as gone,\u201d\u00a0is\u00a0both vulnerable and defiant, soaring with pop-inflected harmonies.\u00a0And with an expansiveness evoking the wide-open West, \u201cWhat it Takes\u201d speaks to the truth of the record, to her life, and to the universe.At its pounding heart,\u00a0Years\u00a0crackles with a pointedly contemporary and relevant take on the outlaw spirit.

The release of the debut single \u201cHole in One\u201d solidified him as an authentic indie-blues artist, earning a loyal underground following. He continued to study the roots of blues and soul music, reinventing his style and reemerging as N.W. Izzard.In 2015, N.W. reconnected with hometown friend Tyler Watts, who was on the tail end of producing an adventure travel documentary, where Izzard was a featured artist on the soundtrack. Sharing a common vision, they began exchanging original songs and ideas while listening to their favorite blues records. In a few days time, songs like Howlin\u2019 Out, Sun\u2019s Gonna Shine and Down to Ride were born. Izzard introduced Watts to the art of busking, performing in the streets of North Central Florida before moving aboard Tyler\u2019s 46\u2019 sailboat and relocating to the Florida Keys. The duo spent the remainder of 2015 writing songs, playing the streets and refining their sound.During that time, another childhood friend, Nathan Ranew, saw the N.W. Izzard duo performing at a music festival and convinced the boys to move to Jax Beach, where there was more opportunities for original music. In 2016, they \u201chit the ground running\u201d earning residencies at Lynch\u2019s Irish Pub and other local venues, playing memorable performances at the infamous Freebird Live and continuing to build their cult-like following. Upon the release of their debut album \u201cNo Sleep\u201d, the band was evolving from a 2 piece into a power trio as Nate transitioned from manger to bass player, and from local stand outs to regional touring artists. The new addition brought forward a new sound and subsequently a new name, The Honey Hounds were born.Following the 2017 release of their EP \u201cMidnight Magic\u201d, the Honey Hounds continue to reenergize western music, embodying the rock n roll lifestyle while embracing the roots of soul and funk. Balancing between righteousness and the mysticism that surrounds the blues culture, they\u2019ve come to represent the resurgence of a genre and the voice of a generation.Currently the boys are touring and playing festivals though out the U.S. and preparing to record their next album.Learn More About the Artist:HONEY HOUNDS: Official Website |\u00a0Facebook\u00a0| Instagram | Spotify"},
