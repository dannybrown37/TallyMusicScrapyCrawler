    "notes": "The Mountain Dew Clogging organization is a family oriented group comprised of people of all ages from all of the counties surrounding Tallahassee.Clogging gives you the opportunity to get out and enjoy a great social activity and get fit at the same time. Your legs will tone up very quickly. Clogging improves flexibility, coordination, endurance and strength. It increases lung capacity, relieves stress, and it\u2019s aerobic and burns fat. Clogging is usually danced in lines because there is a better social group feeling when you can see that your new friends are dancing the same routines as you. Some couple and partner routines are taught to keep in touch with the historic Appalachian clogging styles.The instructors teach both the steps and the routines. During classes the instructors cue or call all routines every time they are danced during the learning phase. This means once you know the steps at a given level, you can quickly join in with routines you have never seen.You will find you dance many and varied routines to pretty much all types of music, although country and top 100 current tunes are the most popular.Taps are a double jingle tap ordered from one of our suppliers. The sound of all the taps beating to the music, gets everybody tapping to the rhythms. In clogging the heel tap is used to give a strong regular beat during most steps.Like other worthwhile sporting activities, to progress quickly you may need to practice more than once a week at class. The good news is you can practice anywhere.",

Characters of depth, integrity and humanity are portrayed unlike anything else in theater today. The performance is a series of scenes taken from everyday life and set to beautiful music by composers such as Beethoven, Vivaldi, Strauss, and Copland. Through a combination of virtuoso manipulation, humor, pathos, classic music, and poetic insight, The Cashore Marionettes take the audience on a journey that celebrates the richness of life.Joseph Cashore has received numerous awards for his artistry including a Pew Fellowship for Performance Art, based upon his artistic accomplishment; a Henson Foundation Grant, an award intended to promote puppetry to adult audiences; and a Citation of Excellence from the North American Center of Union Internationale de la Marionnette (UNIMA-USA), the highest honor an American puppeteer can receive.

You cannot hide behind these two genres. What you get in the studio is what you get onstage. And it\u2019s that vulnerability and honesty that sets the tone and attitude apart from the haphazard and polished nature of pop radio. Putting their music through the prism of string music, The Grass Is Dead showcases how Jerry & Co. buried innumerable gems of wisdom \u2014 sonically and spiritually \u2014 in the rich tapestry of their melodies and lyrics, all of which radiates in intimacy and inclusiveness of The Grass Is Dead when they stand in front of the microphone, and also the unknown night of curiosity and exploration that they seek out and grasp with such ease.\u201d\n\u2014 Garret K.

She fell in love with Folk music at the young age of eleven after buying her first \"Peter, Paul, and Mary\" album. About a year ago, at eighteen, Xaris jumped into the world of being a traveling musician; just a young girl and her guitar. A self proclaimed Folksinger, her music style falls somewhere between American Folk and Classic Country. According to listeners, Xaris's voice is reminiscent of young Dolly Parton, Allison Krauss, and Joan Baez. Xaris is currently recording an album of Old Folk Songs with BigTone Records out of Bristol, VA.

The R&T know how the tread wears down on the tires when you play 140 shows in year cross-country.

    "notes": "dance, flamenco\n\nFarruquito (Juan Manuel Fern\u00e1ndez Montoya), heir to the most renowned Gypsy flamenco dynasty, was immersed in the purest form of flamenco, founded by his grandfather, \u201cEl Farruco,\u201d one of the greatest dancers in the history of flamenco. In 2015, Farruquito was invited to dance with the LA Phil, in four sold-out gala concerts of an adapted version of Amor Brujo directed by Gustavo Dudamel at the Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles. Farruquito returned to the United Stated for a coast-to-coast tour in 2016 and was hailed by The New York Times as the, \u201cgreatest flamenco dancer of his century.\u201dHe has made it his life\u2019s mission to share the purest form of flamenco on stages all around the world while further broadening his influence by collaborating with the most influential artists of our time. From birth his first appearance on stage was on Broadway at 4 years of age with his grandfather in the hit Flamenco Puro. At 11, he was featured in the film Flamenco, which launched his career and positioned him amongst the most elite flamenco artists of the world. He created his first show, Ra\u00edces Flamencas (Flamenco Roots) at 15, which demonstrated his mastery as a dancer and gave him the opportunity to showcase the traditions of his prodigious flamenco line.Previous Event Next Event",

    "notes": "Hailing from Richmond, VA, The Trongone Band is touring in support of their 2017 debut album, \u201cKeys to the House\u201d, released on Harmonized Records. With a sound that Paste Magazine likens to the \u201cfreak-outs of My Morning Jacket with the Muscle Shoals-inspired Leslie speakers and The Band\u2019s narrative storytelling\u201d, The Trongone Band is turning heads and making an impact on the Southern Rock \u2018n\u2019 Soul and Americana scenes.Formed by brothers Andrew and Johnny Trongone with father John Sr on bass, The Trongone Band (tron-GO-knee) has grown from a family affair to a full on touring machine with the addition of keyboardist Ben \u201cWolfe\u201d White and bassist Chip Hale. In the words of Live for Live Music, \u201cthe quartet has come together to create an old-school and all-in-the-family sound reminiscent of The Allman Brothers while still keeping it fresh with their cutting edge original compositions that also infuse funk and blues into the mix.\u201dKeeping with the homegrown vibe, the band nestled into the woods outside of RVA, tapping into Montrose Recording\u2019s Flickinger console, one of only seven remaining in the world. Known as the console that revolutionized the recording industry in the 60s & 70s, the Flickinger provided the warm sounds that turned into \u201cKeys to the House\u201d and brought to life what MusicFestNews described as \u201cimagery of boxcar drifters, rolling hills and dirt roads that are easy to close your eyes and get lost in\u201d.Summer and Fall of 2017 saw The Trongone Band taking \u201cKeys to the House\u201d on the road while touring in support of stalwarts including Umphrey\u2019s McGee, Reckless Kelly, American Aquarium and Cris Jacobs. Having graced the stages of Virginia\u2019s Roosterwalk and FloydFest, Tennessee\u2019s Riverbend Music Festival, The Allman Brothers\u2019 Peach Festival in Pennsylvania, Atlanta\u2019s Sweetwater 420 Fest and Macon\u2019s \u201cBig House Presents Summer Jam\u201d, the band is primed for a busy 2018 festival season and their first full European Tour. This four-piece ensemble may not all be related, but with a chemistry so emphatically discernible, it\u2019s fair to call them brothers.Learn More About the Artist:THE TRONGONE BAND: Official Website | Facebook\u00a0",

Louisiana, Mobile, and Apalachicola, Florida. For more information, check the website, www.crossculturalcoalition.org, or email the organizers at artigras2019@gmail.com."

    "notes": "For centuries scientists and engineers have worked within the limitations of the natural world to expand the palette on which musicians can create. This symbiotic relationship is not always widely appreciated, and is symptomatic of much more fundamental connections between science and art that extend into many arenas. Both science and art are driven by intuition and creativity, and both allow genius to express itself in the context of artificial or natural \u201crules\u201d. Understanding the physical nature of music illuminates the beauty of this creative process. Music, science and engineering are connected at many levels. I will use live keyboard demonstrations to illuminate how the origin of some musical styles, particularly blues piano, can be found in fundamental properties of sound and music. In particular, I will focus on the evolution of the scale and its impact on harmony and melody in western music.Murray Gibson became the Dean of the FAMU-FSU College of Engineering in 2016. \u00a0He grew up in the United Kingdom and holds a PhD in Physics from the University of Cambridge. He has a long career in industry and academia and has been Head of the Electronics and Photonics Materials Research Department at Bell Laboratories, \u00a0Associate Director of the Argonne National Laboratory, Professor at the University of Illinois in Urbana Champaign, and Founding Dean of the College of Science at Northeastern University. Gibson\u2019s \u00a0research has focused on the understanding of atomic structure in nanomaterials, and how it influences physical properties. \u00a0He has published over 200 papers, holds several patents and is a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the Royal Microscopical Society and the American Physical Society. His hobbies include playing the piano."

Hailed as a \u201cming-blowingly good\u201d (Greg Vandy, KEXP) \u201ctutorial on classic country music\u201d (Popmatters), Pinnell\u2019s debut immediately differentiated as authentic and unflinching. Dogged touring through Europe and the states and celebrated radio sessions followed, cementing Pinnell\u2019s position as a no-fuss master of his craft.His 2017 album Ties of Blood and Affection presents a canny lateral move.\u00a0\u00a0Instead of doubling down on the stark themes and values of his debut, this sophomore album finds Pinnell finding comfort in his own skin and achieving the redemption only hinted at in his previous batch of haunted songs.\u00a0\u00a0Here Pinnell joyfully embraces the working life, family obligations, and faith.\u00a0\u00a0His new stories delve into acceptance and survival, all the while investigating his most challenging chapter yet: adulthood. \u00a0While \u201cIf life don\u2019t get any better / I\u2019m alright with this\u201d isn\u2019t an out-right triumph, it\u2019s an honest revelation.You can feel the room breathe and get a sense of these musicians eyeballing each other as their performances are committed directly to thick analog tape. Honest and careworn, Jeremy\u2019s voice can touch on wry, jubilant, and debauched \u2013 all in a single line. Ties of Blood and Affection offers a fair dose resolution to Jeremy\u2019s story. At his best, Jeremy Pinnell chronicles the joy and sorrow of being human, which is the best that anyone could do.LEARN MORE ABOUT THE ARTIST:JEREMY PINELL: Official Website |\u00a0Facebook\u00a0| Instagram | Youtube\u201cHardscrabble honky-tonk at its best, nodding to Johnny Cash and Buck Owens in equal measure.

His voice is strong and a little mournful \u2014 you can feel his ache seep through the speakers as you\u00a0listen\u00a0\u2014 and the rhythm section shuffles along gently. Weepy pedal steel licks feel just right as Pinnell sings a regretful refrain of \u2018I did it again,\u2019 a familiar sentiment for any of us who\u2019ve ever done a little backsliding.\u201d \u2013 THE BLUEGRASS SITUATION",

His guitar playing has been featured on three Grammy\u00ae-nominated albums, including the soundtrack of the Academy-Award winning film The Descendants.Makana\u2019s captivating and wide-ranging performance style has led him to share the stage with Jason Mraz and Jack Johnson, open for music legends Sting, Carlos Santana and Elvis Costello, and perform in venues ranging from Asian and European opera houses to The White House.Born and raised in Hawai\u2019i, Makana grew up on the shores of Waikiki amid the diversity of such legends as Don Ho and Bruno Mars. Makana \u2014 whose name means \u201ca gift given freely\u201d \u2014 began singing when he was 7 years old, took up ukulele at 9 and began learning the ancient art of slack key at 11. By 14, he was performing professionally, and before long, playing five nights a week. His reputation as the youngest virtuoso\u00a0of slack key spread like molten volcanic lava throughout the islands.The focus of Makana\u2019s art is to celebrate the beauty of tradition while exploring new, relevant perceptions, sounds and themes. In his music he often honors his forebearers, the vintage Hawaiian music legends as well as the rock poet idols of the \u201960s, paying homage to the kupuna (elders) who carry within their Beings the cultural wisdom passed down through generations.Previous Event Next Event",

While there, he performed throughout Britain as a headliner and also shared the bill with such artists as Bert Jansch, Tim Hardin and Elvis Costello. After returning to the United States, Lord shared the bill with such artists as Richie Havens, The Rowan Brothers, Sonny Terry & Brownie McGhee, Sam & Dave, Vassar Clements, Albert King and Brewer & Shipley, among others.Born in Jersey City, New Jersey, Lord\u2019s early influences included such artists as James Taylor and Leonard Cohen. Later, Lord became inspired by artists of the British folk/blues revival, especially Bert Jansch and Ralph McTell, and Lord\u2019s first album \u201cInside Out\u201d, produced by former \u201cFugs\u2019 guitarist Ken Pine and released on the Inlet Records label in October 1982, was a Billboard Magazine Top Billboard Album Pick (recommended LP). Lord\u2019s second album \u201cHangdog Heaven\u201d, released on the Blue Vinyl Records label in March 2000 and produced by Ken Pine and Larry Gates, was characterized by the New York Post as a \u201c\u2026dozen-song man-and-a-guitar disc [that] freely crosses the borders of folk rock, contemporary country and old-fashioned jazz guitar.\u201d\nInfluences include Bert Jansch, Ralph McTell, James Taylor, Leonard Cohen and Tom Waits.We\u2019ll also be offering $1 off all local craft drafts for the night so come out and join the fun!LEARN MORE ABOUT THE ARTIST:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/JimLordSingerSongwriter/\nhttps://www.jimlord.com/"

The band, who originally cut their teeth playing the oyster bars and listening rooms of the Florida Panhandle, has since written and released two full-length albums: their studio debut Follow (2014), called \u201ceye-opening, but warmly familiar\u201d by Earmilk, and whose title track is \u201cone of the most beautiful pieces of music I\u2019ve ever heard\u201d (Todd Moe of NCPR); and sophomore effort West of Here (2016), with its \u201ctight-as-a-rubber-band\u201d harmonies and \u201cinfectious\u201d songwriting (PopMatters).For their third album, This Side of the Glass (2019), The Currys teamed up with producer/guitarist Sam Whedon and engineer Stewart Myers (Jason Mraz, Parachute) to map new terrain. As ever, the band\u2019s three-part family harmonies provide the organic, lived-in feel of roots music, but the album aspires to a greater variety of tone, form, and orchestration than earlier releases. The songs defy categorization into any one genre: the country nostalgia of \u201cGulf Coast Home\u201d complements the folk-pop sensibility of \u201cPin You Down,\u201d while the guitars and gang vocals of \u201cSoon Enough\u201d pay unmistakable homage to Paul Simon\u2019s \u201cGraceland.\u201dLyrically, This Side of the Glass explores questions of perspective, an apt consideration for a band featuring three songwriters. Each Curry offers his take on the time-worn threads of life and love, contributing to the album\u2019s tapestry of introspection and social commentary. Likewise, each in turn ruminates on the paradox faced by every performing songwriter: how to balance one\u2019s roles as both the author of stories and the object of storytelling. This Side of the Glass is an insightful and satisfying new chapter from a band with many more stories to tell.The Currys kick off the This Side of the Glass tour in early March, joined by Whedon on guitar and supported by Sebastian Green (drums) and Alex Rees (keys, organ).Our kitchen will also be open for the evening from 6pm until 9:30pm, giving you plenty of time to enjoy a delicious meal during the show!This night will be packed, so grab a ticket before they\u2019re gone!

His numerous accolades include the prestigious Ivor Novella International Award (2012) and the Academy of Country Music\u2019s Poet Award (2016). In 2016 Rolling Stone magazine listed Webb as one of the top 50 songwriters of all time.

But then, you remember her songs and her playing. And it hits you: brash, beautiful originality is exactly what Molly is doing.The 2017 release of her debut EP Rise further introduced Molly to a roots music audience who had already enthusiastically embraced and elevated her. Her 2017 and 2018 wins for Guitar Player of the Year from the International Bluegrass Association (IBMA) were history-making, as the first woman to be nominated for the honor, and the accolades have kept coming in 2018 with Folk Alliance International\u00a0awarding her\u00a0\u201c\u00a0Song of the Year\u201d for\u00a0\u201cYou Didn\u2019t Call My Name\u201d during the\u00a0International Folk Music Awards.

In between tours, she has been hard at work in the studio crafting her eagerly-anticipated debut album with producer/engineer Ryan Hewitt (Avett Brothers, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Lumineers), which will be released in early 2019 on Compass Records.Previous Event Next Event",

No refunds or exchanges of ticket purchases. Advance tickets will also be on sale electronically via Eventbrite and in person with NO FEES at\u00a0Finnegan\u2019s Wake\u00a0Irish Pub.This incredible trio was created by Detroit native and internationally acclaimed percussionist Gerald Cleaver, in collaboration with Larry Ochs, founder of the legendary Rova Saxophone Quartet. With the addition in 2015 of experimental guitar icon Nels Cline (who belatedly became a pop-guitar icon by joining Wilco) the trio\u2019s lineup was complete.NELS CLINE might be as close as the modern avant-garde gets to a household name. Before joining indie rock institution Wilco in 2004, Cline divided his energy between improvised contexts alongside Julius Hemphill, Vinny Golia, and brother Alex, and more song-oriented settings like Carla Bozulich\u2019s alt-country outfit Geraldine Fibbers and Mike Watt\u2019s Crew of the Flying Saucer. Cline continues to occupy the narrow space between pure sound and song, as exemplified by his longstanding Singers trio with drummer Scott Amendola and bassist Trevor Dunn, and his recent duo with guitar prodigy Julian Lage.\u00a0www.nelscline.comIn his own words, Detroit-bred, New York-based GERALD CLEAVER\u2019s multifaceted approach to the drum set balances \u201cstatic sound and extreme dynamics, melodicism within heavy texture, deep-rooted groove, unchained abandon, and the power and revelation of recurring form.\u201d Cleaver made a name for himself through enduring partnerships with Vision Fest regulars like Roscoe Mitchell and Charles Gayle, but lately critics have been abuzz about his new musique concr\u00e8te-cum-free rock quintet Black Host with Darius Jones, Cooper-Moore, Brandon Seabrook, and Pascal Niggenkemper. Pitchfork\u2019s Hank Shteamer described 2013\u2019s Life in the Sugar Candle Mines as, \u201ca well-tended hot-house: feverish and bracingly weird, yet also purposeful and shrewdly strategic.\u201dLARRY OCHS is best known as a founder of the Rova Sax Quartet, a San Francisco institution that pioneered the application of improvisational strategies within the context of contemporary composition, beginning in the late 1970s and continuing right up to the present day: 40 years old in 2018. Equally inspired by modernist 20th century composition and the more worldly, abrasive strands of 60s free jazz, Rova and Ochs became widely celebrated for the lengths they would go to stretch the performance parameters of notated music through early collaborations with Henry Kaiser, Fred Frith, and John Zorn. Ochs connection with Cline began in the late 1990\u2019s and culminated with the Celestial Septet, a septet comprised of both the Rova Sax Quartet and the Nels Cline Singers, with a fantastic CD release including a long, ecstatic Ochs composition and tours from 2009 \u2013 2011. Ochs and Cleaver have performed off and on as a duo since 2013; a duo CD release (coming in 2018) \u2013 a beautiful , haunting set of music called \u201cSongs of the Wild Cave\u201d \u2013 will document their 2016 live recording made inside a secret cave in the Dordogne area of France; a cave that contains upwards of 150 Pleistocene-era paintings. It\u2019s a unique recording in which the cave itself seriously influenced the music, becoming essentially the third member of a trio.\u00a0www.ochs.ccLearn More About the Artist:NELS CLINE \u2013 GERALD CLEAVER \u2013 LARRY OCHS:\u00a0Official Website",

    "notes": "americana\n\nRosanne Cash is on tour with She Remembers Everything, a poetic, lush and soulful collection of songs that reckon with a flawed and fragile world. She Remembers Everything follows Rosanne\u2019s triple-Grammy winning 2014 album \u2018The River & the Thread\u2019 and marks a return to more personal songwriting after a trio of albums that explored her southern roots and family heritage. In the wake of the latest tsunami of survivor stories, Cash has embraced women\u2019s narratives in this powerful material.\u00a0 \u201cThere is a woman\u2019s real life, complex experiences and layered understanding in these songs,\u201d Rosanne says. \u201cI could not have written them 10 years ago\u2014not even close. Time is shorter, I have more to say.\u201d She Remembers Everything was produced by collaborator John Leventhal and Tucker Martine (The Decemberists, My Morning Jacket, Mavis Staples, Neko Case).One of the country\u2019s pre-eminent singer/ songwriters, Rosanne Cash has released 15 albums of extraordinary songs that have earned 4 Grammy Awards and 11 nominations, as well as 21 top 40 hits, including 11 No. 1 singles.She was awarded the SAG/AFTRA Lifetime Achievement award for Sound Recordings in 2012 and received the 2014 Smithsonian Ingenuity Award in the Performing Arts. She\u00a0was chosen as a Perspective Series artist at Carnegie Hall for the 2015-16 season, and curated a series of American roots music, including her own\u00a0performance.She continues her association with Carnegie Hall as a Creative Partner for the 2018-19 season. She also served as 2015 Artist-in-Residence at the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum in Nashville and was inducted into the Nashville Songwriters\u2019 Hall of Fame that same year.And for the 2017-2018 seasons she was a Resident Artistic Director at SFJAZZ.\u00a0\u00a0Earlier this year Cash was awarded with the Spirit of Americana: Free Speech Award and received an honorary doctorate degree from the Berklee College of Music.Cash is currently writing the lyrics for a musical Norma Rae with John Leventhal, composer, and John Weidman, book writer.Previous Event ",

    "notes": "Since 2008 the Bach Parley has been performing primarily on period instruments, that is, harpsichord and baroque style stringed instruments with gut strings. The group focuses on music of Johann Sebastian Bach, his contemporaries, as well as pieces written before J. S. Bach was born with music written in the years 1600-1750.Performing on period-style instruments, the Bach Parley offers unique, exceptional concert experiences to educate and engage our community. We present Baroque music as it was performed hundreds of years ago with a fresh, accessible sound for today\u2019s audiences. The French word \u201cparley\u201d means discussion and a key element of Bach Parley concerts is the commentary provided by Music Director Valerie Arsenault who gives historical context about the composers and offers suggestions about what to listen for in the music.The Tallahassee Bach Parley is also the umbrella organization for a non-profit music school. In 2015, four teachers united to teach violin, viola, and cello at the Bach Parley String Academy at St. John\u2019s Episcopal church, and now the Academy has grown to six teachers, almost 100 students, and even offers ukulele classes.At all Sunday Tallahassee Bach Parley concerts this season, patrons will receive an insert in their programs with a discount coupon to use after the concert at participating downtown area restaurants. A $10 donation is suggested, and free childcare will be offered. The Bach Parley will hold their annual membership reception after the concert.For additional information about the Tallahassee Bach Parley, including the Bach Parley String Academy music school, visit www.bachparley.org.Enjoy the music, the venue, and the magic of Baroque performance with the Tallahassee Bach Parley!Don\u2019t miss our annual membership reception after the concert\u2026"
