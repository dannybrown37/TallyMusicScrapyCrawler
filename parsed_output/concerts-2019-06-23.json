Your legs will tone up very quickly. Clogging improves flexibility, coordination, endurance and strength. It increases lung capacity, relieves stress, and it\u2019s aerobic and burns fat. Clogging is usually danced in lines because there is a better social group feeling when you can see that your new friends are dancing the same routines as you. Some couple and partner routines are taught to keep in touch with the historic Appalachian clogging styles.The instructors teach both the steps and the routines. During classes the instructors cue or call all routines every time they are danced during the learning phase. This means once you know the steps at a given level, you can quickly join in with routines you have never seen.You will find you dance many and varied routines to pretty much all types of music, although country and top 100 current tunes are the most popular.Taps are a double jingle tap ordered from one of our suppliers. The sound of all the taps beating to the music, gets everybody tapping to the rhythms. In clogging the heel tap is used to give a strong regular beat during most steps.Like other worthwhile sporting activities, to progress quickly you may need to practice more than once a week at class. The good news is you can practice anywhere.",

His first instrument was a dulcimer his father built. Then came drums at age 13, and guitar at 16. Having a career in music has always been his dream, and he\u2019s been making it a reality for the past few years, touring the country and releasing his debut album earlier this year called \u201cDifferent Faces.\u201dMore about Backstage Pass\nBackstage Pass grew out of the Concerts in the Park series begun in 1986, by Florida First Federal and late community leader, Roger Schadd. From 1986 to 2008, free outdoor concerts were held every summer featuring local bands. In order to keep the series going during the recession, Backstage Pass began welcoming guests through the Backstage Door of the Marina Civic Center in 2009, and the first band was \u201cOn Call\u201d, led by the late Hulon Crayton. Tickets were $5 (and they still are) and the community embraced it from the first downbeat. We are so grateful to continue this wonderful tradition."

Alabama introduced rock style guitars, lights, pyrotechnics and sounds to the country audience that has inspired many of today's brightest country stars including Kenny Chesney, Jason Aldean and Luke Bryan.\u00a0While their music continues to stand the test of time, their numbers and stats are beyond compare. 50 years since starting the band, Alabama has charted 43 #1 singles including 21 #1 singles in a row and have won over 179 CMA Awards, Grammy Awards, and ACM Awards. They are members of the Country Music Hall of Fame and have their own star of the Hollywood Walk of Fame. They are also world-class philanthropists who have raised over 250 Million dollars for charity. Celebrate 50 years of ALABAMA on their 50th Anniversary Tour coming to the Donald L.

The band creates rich harmonies and unforgettable songs of love, heartbreak and exploration. Roanoke uses their undeniable musical chemistry to create a unique and captivating sound full of cultural influences, roots instrumentation and catchy, memorable melodies. Their self-titled debut album Roanoke is an invigoratingly classic Americana album filled with modern yet vintage tunes that make the audience sit and listen to a back-porch tale in true Americana fashion. Roanoke has struck a balance between the narrative songwriting of folk, the ear candy appeal of pop and the roots authenticity of country music.
