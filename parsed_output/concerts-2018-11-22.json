    "notes": "Joey Gilmore\u2019s\u00a0love affair with the guitar began in his teens. \u201cIn the town that I lived in, there was a barbershop,\u201d Gilmore reminisces. \u201cAnd the barber that owned the shop was a sanctified preacher. He was a minister, and he had this little flat-bodied guitar. It was electric, no amplifier to it. And he would bring it to the shop with him, and he was trying to learn how to play. So, I would get to the barbershop early whenever I would go to get my hair cut, or even after school, I would hang around at the barbershop, because I wanted to get my hands on that guitar. I would take the guitar and they had these old wooden benches. I would lay the guitar on top of the wooden bench and when you would strum the strings, the wood, the bench, would vibrate, and the floor would, the sound would resonate, and you could hear it without the amplifier. I learned just from watching him.\u201d Young Gilmore tried to keep his obsession with the instrument from his church going aunt, who was raising him, but word of the talented boy who played at the barbershop eventually got back to her.\u201dDecades later and established as a Florida legend, Joey Gilmore provides a highlight at Blues Festivals and night clubs all over the world as one of the best soul-blues and R&B singers in the business. Joey Gilmore has shared the stage with Such Greats As James Brown, Etta James, Bobby Bland, Little Milton, Johnny Taylor and numerous others. In January 2006 Joey Gilmore won one of the most distinguished and internationally coveted awards in all of blues. The IBC. Joey Gilmore outscored all artist worldwide while showcasing his amazing talent at a blues industry event. Making him the best unsigned Artist on the planet. In 2008 Joey Gilmore was awarded the Blewzzy award for best song, BLUES ALL OVER YOU.\u00a0 In 2015 Joey Gilmore was\u00a0honored with\u00a0Latin World Talent\u00a0Lifetime Achievement Award.\u00a0 He continues to soar in the music industry.In Jan. 2015, Joey released his new CD titled BRANDON\u2019S BLUES on Mosher St. Records.In Feb. 2016 Joey is releasing his next CD titled RESPECT THE BLUES on Mosher St. Records.Joey\u2019s outstanding band members.Joey Gilmore \u2013 Guitar and VocalsRobert\u00a0\u201cHi-Hat\u201d Carter \u2013 BassMaurice Dukes \u2013 DrumsSonny Boy Williams, KeyboardsDottie Kelly\u00a0\u2013 Vocals"

Your legs will tone up very quickly. Clogging improves flexibility, coordination, endurance and strength. It increases lung capacity, relieves stress, and it\u2019s aerobic and burns fat. Clogging is usually danced in lines because there is a better social group feeling when you can see that your new friends are dancing the same routines as you. Some couple and partner routines are taught to keep in touch with the historic Appalachian clogging styles.The instructors teach both the steps and the routines. During classes the instructors cue or call all routines every time they are danced during the learning phase. This means once you know the steps at a given level, you can quickly join in with routines you have never seen.You will find you dance many and varied routines to pretty much all types of music, although country and top 100 current tunes are the most popular.Taps are a double jingle tap ordered from one of our suppliers. The sound of all the taps beating to the music, gets everybody tapping to the rhythms. In clogging the heel tap is used to give a strong regular beat during most steps.Like other worthwhile sporting activities, to progress quickly you may need to practice more than once a week at class. The good news is you can practice anywhere.",

Starting with house parties and guest slots at small clubs, he quickly graduated to long residencies in several nightclubs. This resulted in a rise in exposure, to the point where he was invited to become the resident mix show DJ on Northern Ireland\u2019s number one-rated commercial radio station Cool FM. The station\u2019s Hiphop show, \u2018The Extended Weekend\u2019 was, at the time, the only urban show in the country.He can now be found behind the turntables at various radio stations across the United States, from New York City all the way down to Tallahassee, FL.\u00a0Dubbed \u2018The Deepest Crates in the 850\u2019 (Tallahassee\u2019s area code) he has an expansive library of music over multiple genres.

With this history lesson in mind, old school rock \u2018n\u2019 soul saxophonist and singer Terry Hanck makes perfect sense. Clearly, Hanck has worshipped at the right Southern altars\u2013 those of such iconic R&B brothers as Fats Domino, Ray Charles, B. B. King, Lee Allen and King Curtis. \u201cI write songs that you think you\u2019ve heard for years,\u201d says the South Florida-based Hanck, who\u2019s got suave movie-star looks and a good time presence that immutably anchors the old-style R&B he adores.\u00a0"

Advance tickets will also be on sale with NO FEES at\u00a0Finnegan\u2019s Wake\u00a0Irish Pub.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Back in January, worn out from having spent a year on tour and facing a new album\u2019s release and another year spent mostly on a bus, away from the comforts of home and family, Patterson Hood decided to try to write a book. He had made a couple of stabs in that direction before (as well as a couple of screenplays) but had so far failed to complete one. The thing is, Patterson loves to write on the road. He writes most every day out there. It\u2019s usually not songs, as completing a song amid all of the noise, distractions and music blasting on the bus is very difficult (he does often start songs there that get finished later) but writing non-musical compositions comes pretty easy for him out there and it sure passes the time. Besides, he had an idea for a story he wanted to write and it started coming very easily. By their third month on the road Patterson already had a pretty firm outline of what he wanted and several chapters that he felt really good about.He was calling his book \u201cSlam Dancing in the Pews\u201d, named after a cassette that Virgil Kane had recorded in 1992 when Cooley and Patterson were playing shows under that name after the break up of Adam\u2019s House Cat. The book was basically half-assed fictionalization of that very turbulent period of Patterson\u2019s life. He was 27, his band broke up, he got divorced and left his hometown to live in Memphis. His car got stolen, the band\u2019s truck got stripped and he fell in love. He fell out with his family (who he was very, very close to) and had his heart broken. He seriously pondered killing himself several times but instead wrote literally over 500 songs in a three-year period. A time when he reinvented himself artistically and experienced a sort of rebirth that led to a lot of the things he has done in the last two decades.His book would sort of tell that story, but interspersed with lyrics from that period of his life, as well as new song lyrics either set in that time or from the point of view of various characters from the book. The structure would be chapter / song / chapter / song and so on. If the book was coming fast, the songs were coming even easier. Then the booked stopped coming. Someday he may want to tell that story, but timing is everything and this just isn\u2019t the time for it.The songs, however continued to pour out, taking a few left turns and then morphing into its own thing. Most of this album comes from that short period of time between February and June of 2011. The songs begin in the period that the book was set in, but don\u2019t end there, as they really just were the impetus for writing about the life he is living now and contrasting it with the troubled times of two decades ago.Patterson Hood called it Heat Lightning Rumbles in the Distance and decided that spring to record it as a solo album. He could clearly hear in his head exactly how he wanted every song to sound and made a list of who he wanted to play on each one. It is in some ways the most personal album Patterson has ever made. There has always been a lot of Patterson in all of the albums they\u2019ve done, but usually semi-disguised as character sketches and stories, but the first person narrative in this one is pretty firmly rooted in autobiography, albeit in two dramatically differing time periods.A Festival of Teeth \u2013 The making of Heat Lightning:David Hood is a session bass player who played on tons of those great Muscle Shoals soul classics back in the day. He played bass on The Staple Singers\u2019 classic \u201cI\u2019ll Take You There\u201d as well as hits by Aretha Franklin, Wilson Pickett, Bobby Womack, Bob Seger, Paul Simon, Willie Nelson and Etta James. He is also Patterson\u2019s dad and he came over to record with him last fall and absolutely outdid himself. His playing on the title cut is just stunning.David Barbe, who has partnered with Patterson on almost everything he\u2019s done for about a decade now, co-produced and played bass on the rest of the album.Kelly Hogan has long been one of Patterson\u2019s favorite people and he knew he wanted her to sing on the album. She has just recently recorded an album of her own and she and Patterson had attempted to co-write a song for it. She sent him a set of lyrics to an unfinished song she was working on about our friend Vic Chesnutt. He loved her lyrics and set about re-writing it and turning it into a song called \u201cCome Back Little Star\u201d which Patterson then sent back to her to complete, but alas she didn\u2019t get it finished in time to make her album and upon deciding to do his album, asked her if he could finish it for the album and she agreed. She came down to Georgia and sang on it and on \u201cAfter The Damage\u201d which Patterson also wrote with her voice in mind. Upon singing her takes she could see through the glass into the control room what she described as \u201cA Festival of Teeth.\u201dAs always, Brad Morgan played drums and just keeps getting better and better all of the time. As a lot of the songs were piano based, Patterson feels he was was fortunate to have Jay Gonzalez playing Andy Baker\u2019s grand piano (on indefinite loan to Chase Park Transduction) as well as Wurlitzer, accordion and Mellotron. John Neff came by to play some spot-on pedal steel and they even got Cooley in to play banjo on a couple of tracks.Patterson\u2019s love for the Denton, Texas band Centro-matic is well known and once again he felt fortunate to have Will Johnson and Scott Danbom in for a few days each to play with him. Will came in October, played some guitar and did some stunning singing. Scott came by in August and played upright piano on \u201cLeaving Time\u201d, then came back in early December and played the fiddle. Patterson had always heard cello on some of these songs and for the first time got to play with Jacob Morris (Madeline, Moths and Old Smokey).In the end, they made the most intimate and personal record of Patterson\u2019s career. He has put together a really phenomenal band, The Downtown Rumblers, to go out and tour behind it and we\u2019re more than thrilled to welcome them to our Mainstage right here in Tallahassee, FL.

Advance tickets will be on sale electronically at https://850tix.com/events/pattersonhood and with NO FEES at Finnegan\u2019s Wake Irish Pub.Back in January, worn out from having spent a year on tour and facing a new album\u2019s release and another year spent mostly on a bus, away from the comforts of home and family, Patterson Hood decided to try to write a book. He had made a couple of stabs in that direction before (as well as a couple of screenplays) but had so far failed to complete one. The thing is, Patterson loves to write on the road. He writes most every day out there. It\u2019s usually not songs, as completing a song amid all of the noise, distractions and music blasting on the bus is very difficult (he does often start songs there that get finished later) but writing non-musical compositions comes pretty easy for him out there and it sure passes the time. Besides, he had an idea for a story he wanted to write and it started coming very easily. By their third month on the road Patterson already had a pretty firm outline of what he wanted and several chapters that he felt really good about.He was calling his book \u201cSlam Dancing in the Pews\u201d, named after a cassette that Virgil Kane had recorded in 1992 when Cooley and Patterson were playing shows under that name after the break up of Adam\u2019s House Cat. The book was basically half-assed fictionalization of that very turbulent period of Patterson\u2019s life. He was 27, his band broke up, he got divorced and left his hometown to live in Memphis. His car got stolen, the band\u2019s truck got stripped and he fell in love. He fell out with his family (who he was very, very close to) and had his heart broken. He seriously pondered killing himself several times but instead wrote literally over 500 songs in a three-year period. A time when he reinvented himself artistically and experienced a sort of rebirth that led to a lot of the things he has done in the last two decades.His book would sort of tell that story, but interspersed with lyrics from that period of his life, as well as new song lyrics either set in that time or from the point of view of various characters from the book. The structure would be chapter / song / chapter / song and so on. If the book was coming fast, the songs were coming even easier. Then the booked stopped coming. Someday he may want to tell that story, but timing is everything and this just isn\u2019t the time for it.The songs, however continued to pour out, taking a few left turns and then morphing into its own thing. Most of this album comes from that short period of time between February and June of 2011. The songs begin in the period that the book was set in, but don\u2019t end there, as they really just were the impetus for writing about the life he is living now and contrasting it with the troubled times of two decades ago.Patterson Hood called it Heat Lightning Rumbles in the Distance and decided that spring to record it as a solo album. He could clearly hear in his head exactly how he wanted every song to sound and made a list of who he wanted to play on each one. It is in some ways the most personal album Patterson has ever made.

Ghent can been found DJ\u2019ing at some of Tallahassee\u2019s biggest parties and events, including Cancuns famous Cinco De Mayo party and Tallahassee\u2019s Warrior Project, football games and proms, and some of Tallahassee\u2019s hottest spots such as Level 8, Cancuns and our very own mainstage! So come out, join the fun, and get ready to get your dance on!",

Paramount after 100 plus years of blues music is the indefinable spirit of deep expression beyond words and notes. The Canadian blues guitar hero and scholar with impeccable taste, personifies that spirit. He sings and plays with an integrity and deeply felt emotion oblivious to fortune or fashion. The glorious result is stunningly emotional, timeless music. Local blues guitar prodigy Joe Fox opens the show."

The Melody Trucks Band came together in early 2017 as she encountered each member within this extended musical family. Their individual styles and influences run the entire span of every music genre: rock, blues, jazz, funk, classical, country, thrash metal, and even world music. This has culminated in fresh and unique interpretations of iconic songs from the genre of Melody\u2019s extended family.The members of the group have shared the stage with The Allman Brothers, Derek Trucks, Willie Nelson, Valor Trucks, Lee Boys, Butch Trucks and the Freight Train, Devon Allman, Duane Trucks, Bonnie Bramlett, Roosevelt Collier, John Popper, Bruce Katz, Ben Sparaco, JJ Grey and Mofro, and countless others.Support for this show will be The Bobby Lee Rodgers Jazz Trio, who takes one back to the Golden Decade when Jazz was the soul of the city. Along with playing his Jazz originals, during performances Bobby Lee Rodgers captures the sounds of the great artists of our time like Miles Davis, John Coltrane, Thelonious Monk and Wes Montgomery. He visits their compositions by putting his original vocabulary and sound into the harmonic structure of the songs.Bobby brings a unique sound to his performance because he plays through a combination of Leslie cabinet and vintage guitar amp which gives him the beautiful sound of an organ and guitar together. A stellar songwriter, vocalist and guitarist he fuses rock, funk, jazz and blues into a magical musical tapestry. He has performed with such great artists as Vassar Clements, Warren Haynes, Widespread Panic, George Porter Jr. and the list goes on and on. His new CD, BLR was just release to rave reviews. Whether playing his originals or capturing sound of the jazz culture, Bobby Lee Rodgers can truly be called one of the new modern day guitar greats.Learn More About the Artist:THE MELODY TRUCKS BAND: Official Website\u00a0|\u00a0Facebook\u00a0|\u00a0InstagramTHE BOBBY LEE RODGERS TRIO: Official Website\u00a0|\u00a0Facebook\u00a0| Youtube",

This resulted in a rise in exposure, to the point where he was invited to become the resident mix show DJ on Northern Ireland\u2019s number one-rated commercial radio station Cool FM. The station\u2019s Hiphop show, \u2018The Extended Weekend\u2019 was, at the time, the only urban show in the country.He can now be found behind the turntables at various radio stations across the United States, from New York City all the way down to Tallahassee, FL.\u00a0Dubbed \u2018The Deepest Crates in the 850\u2019 (Tallahassee\u2019s area code) he has an expansive library of music over multiple genres.

As of 2018 Gales has recorded seventeen albums for major record labels and has done session and tribute work. He has also contributed vocals on several records by the Memphis rap groups Prophet Posse and Three 6 Mafia under the name Lil E. Gales picked up the guitar at age four and was playing in blues competitions by the age of 10. Although Gales plays a right-handed guitar \"upside-down\" (with the bass E string on the bottom), he is not naturally left-handed; he was taught by his brother, who is left-handed, and never second-guessed the untraditional technique. This will be an all-seating show with the exception of bar and overflow areas only."

Their sophomore EP showcases the evolution of their musical journey and invites you to join them in enduring life\u2019s challenges with a positive outlook and \u201cPut On a Happy Face\u201d.Opening for The Bad Verbs is Revel in Romance. With a blitz of tight, rhythmic instrumentation, wall-of-sound punk allusions, and ethereal, 3-dimensional synths, Revel in Romance, (a 5-piece Alt. Pop Rock Band out of Atlanta, GA.), has achieved a soundscape as in-depth as it is relatable. Their lead vocalist, Saxony Raine, is the 2016 GA Music Awards Winner for Best Female Rock Artist. They have been featured at several prominent festivals and conferences across the U.S. including Warped Tour, SXSW, Summerfest and Sweetwater 420.

By the end of the upbeat Latin-themed opening number, 38 days have passed, and the birds are a little tired of cruising. The Counting Crows have lost count, the Mockingbird is getting on everyone\\\u2019s nerves, and no one has heard from the wise old owl. Even Red Robin Williams, the resident stand-up comic, finds his jokes falling flat.A Bat, traumatized by being forced to live with the mammals (lions and tigers and bears!) then tries to sneak into the bird sanctuary. The Dove, a kind-hearted bird with dreams of being a great explorer, immediately befriends the Bat, but the Raven calls him a \u201cfreak.\u201dUnder the Rainbow explores, through the magic of musical theatre, what it means to be different \u2014 and how our differences make us all stronger and more beautiful, both individually and as a group.\u00a0With appearances from Katy Parrot, the resident pop star, and\u00a0Blue Jay Z, along with the rap stylings of the Angry Birds, these avian adventurers learn, by the time this story is over,\u00a0that \u201cThe Sky Is the Limit,\u201d and their adventure has just begun."

    "notes": "In 2012, Izzard was a college dropout living in Orlando, pursuing music full time. The release of the debut single \u201cHole in One\u201d solidified him as an authentic indie-blues artist, earning a loyal underground following. He continued to study the roots of blues and soul music, reinventing his style and reemerging as N.W. Izzard.In 2015, N.W. reconnected with hometown friend Tyler Watts, who was on the tail end of producing an adventure travel documentary, where Izzard was a featured artist on the soundtrack. Sharing a common vision, they began exchanging original songs and ideas while listening to their favorite blues records. In a few days time, songs like Howlin\u2019 Out, Sun\u2019s Gonna Shine and Down to Ride were born. Izzard introduced Watts to the art of busking, performing in the streets of North Central Florida before moving aboard Tyler\u2019s 46\u2019 sailboat and relocating to the Florida Keys. The duo spent the remainder of 2015 writing songs, playing the streets and refining their sound.During that time, another childhood friend, Nathan Ranew, saw the N.W. Izzard duo performing at a music festival and convinced the boys to move to Jax Beach, where there was more opportunities for original music. In 2016, they \u201chit the ground running\u201d earning residencies at Lynch\u2019s Irish Pub and other local venues, playing memorable performances at the infamous Freebird Live and continuing to build their cult-like following. Upon the release of their debut album \u201cNo Sleep\u201d, the band was evolving from a 2 piece into a power trio as Nate transitioned from manger to bass player, and from local stand outs to regional touring artists. The new addition brought forward a new sound and subsequently a new name, The Honey Hounds were born.Following the 2017 release of their EP \u201cMidnight Magic\u201d, the Honey Hounds continue to reenergize western music, embodying the rock n roll lifestyle while embracing the roots of soul and funk. Balancing between righteousness and the mysticism that surrounds the blues culture, they\u2019ve come to represent the resurgence of a genre and the voice of a generation.Currently the boys are touring and playing festivals though out the U.S. and preparing to record their next album.Learn More About the Artist:HONEY HOUNDS: Official Website |\u00a0Facebook\u00a0| Instagram | Spotify",

    "notes": "Since 2008 the Bach Parley has been performing primarily on period instruments, that is, harpsichord and baroque style stringed instruments with gut strings. The group focuses on music of Johann Sebastian Bach, his contemporaries, as well as pieces written before J. S. Bach was born with music written in the years 1600-1750.Performing on period-style instruments, the Bach Parley offers unique, exceptional concert experiences to educate and engage our community. We present Baroque music as it was performed hundreds of years ago with a fresh, accessible sound for today\u2019s audiences. The French word \u201cparley\u201d means discussion and a key element of Bach Parley concerts is the commentary provided by Music Director Valerie Arsenault who gives historical context about the composers and offers suggestions about what to listen for in the music.The Tallahassee Bach Parley is also the umbrella organization for a non-profit music school. In 2015, four teachers united to teach violin, viola, and cello at the Bach Parley String Academy at St. John\u2019s Episcopal church, and now the Academy has grown to six teachers, almost 100 students, and even offers ukulele classes.At all Sunday Tallahassee Bach Parley concerts this season, patrons will receive an insert in their programs with a discount coupon to use after the concert at participating downtown area restaurants. A $10 donation is suggested, and free childcare will be offered. The Bach Parley will hold their annual membership reception after the concert.For additional information about the Tallahassee Bach Parley, including the Bach Parley String Academy music school, visit www.bachparley.org.Enjoy the music, the venue, and the magic of Baroque performance with the Tallahassee Bach Parley!"

No refunds or exchanges of ticket purchases. Advance tickets will also be on sale electronically via Eventbrite and in person with NO FEES at\u00a0Finnegan\u2019s Wake\u00a0Irish Pub.When\u00a0Sidelong,\u00a0Sarah Shook & the Disarmers\u2019 debut album, was released in early 2017, it quickly earned kudos for its blast of fresh, fierce honesty and sly wit. It was a welcome new voice in a genre too often mired in the staid and conventional. And while that record may have come to many as a surprise,\u00a0Years\u00a0solidifies the point: Sarah Shook & the Disarmers have moved from getting people\u2019s attention to commanding it. The album\u2013with its\u00a0sharpened songwriting, unique perspective, deepened sound and roll-up-your-sleeves attitude\u2013will grab you by the collar and put a defiant finger to your chest. It is resolute, blunt, and unflinching.Inspired by artists such as the Sex Pistols, Elliott Smith and Hank Williams, Sarah sings with confidence, control, and, at times, a hint of menace.\u00a0The Disarmers match her on every track, coloring the tales of resilience and empathy with as much urgency as ever as well as a broader sonic sweep.\u00a0It\u2019s easy to hear Sarah as a close cousin to artists like\u00a0Hurray for the Riff Raff\u00a0and\u00a0Margo Price\u00a0on the title track, or in the country-\u201860s mod vibe on \u201cLesson.\u201d \u201cGood as Gold,\u201d sporting a kiss-off line for the ages,\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re as good as gold/ I\u2019m as good as gone,\u201d\u00a0is\u00a0both vulnerable and defiant, soaring with pop-inflected harmonies.\u00a0And with an expansiveness evoking the wide-open West, \u201cWhat it Takes\u201d speaks to the truth of the record, to her life, and to the universe.At its pounding heart,\u00a0Years\u00a0crackles with a pointedly contemporary and relevant take on the outlaw spirit. Built around the\u00a0buoyant pedal steel\u00a0of Phil Sullivan, and the\u00a0post-punk rattle\u00a0and\u00a0Live at San Quentin\u00a0hum\u00a0of Eric Peterson\u2019s guitar, there are echoes of\u00a0Nikki Lane\u00a0and\u00a0Merle Haggard\u00a0as much as\u00a0Ty Segall.\u00a0Its home is the ragged-but-real\u00a0honky tonk,\u00a0not the bro-country \u201chonky tonk.\u201d The barroom singalong \u201cNew Ways to Fail\u201d is classic, smile-through-the-pain country.\u00a0\u201cDamned If I Do\u201d could be the \u201cDrivin\u2019 Nails in My Coffin\u201d of the 21st century, if we let it; a perfect song for rolling in the wry and sneaking in a quick two-step.\u00a0The sinister \u201cThe Bottle Never Lets Me Down\u201d will get anyone who\u2019s ever been wronged righteously flipping the bird as they knock back the next shot. Therapy in the face of personal devastation takes many forms, after all.As Sarah herself tells it\u2026\u201cThis record is about finding a way.\u00a0 A way through exhaustion, depression, betrayal, hangover after hangover, upper after downer after upper, fight after never-ending fight.\u00a0 It\u2019s about picking yourself up and dusting yourself off after years of being trampled and beaten down, jutting your chin out, head high, after they\u2019ve done their worst, and saying, \u201cStill here.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0This record is shouting \u201cf**k you, I do want I want\u201d from the rooftops to the mother******g cosmos.\u201dLearn More About the Artist:Sarah Shook & The Disarmers:\u00a0Official Website\u00a0|\u00a0Facebook\u00a0|\u00a0Youtube\u00a0| Instagram |\u00a0Twitter",

An essential component of the original Motown machine\u2014that amazing engine invented by Berry Gordy\u2014The Temps began their musical life in Detroit in the early sixties. It wasn\u2019t until 1964, however, that the Smokey Robinson written-and-produced \u201cThe Way You Do the Things You Do\u201d turned the guys into stars.An avalanche of hits followed, many of which\u2026\u201dMy Girl,\u201d for instance\u2026attained immortality. \u201cIt\u2019s Growing,\u201d \u201cSince I Lost My Baby,\u201d \u201cGet Ready,\u201d \u201cAin\u2019t Too Proud to Beg,\u201d \u201cBeauty Is only Skin Deep,\u201d \u201cI Wish It Would Rain\u201d\u2026the hits kept coming. The Temptations were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1989 and received a Grammy\u00ae Lifetime Achievement Award in 2013.Originally called the Four Aims, the Four Tops made their first single for Chess in 1956, and spent seven years on the road and in nightclubs, singing pop, blues, Broadway, but mostly jazz\u2014four-part harmony jazz.Their first Motown hit, \u201cBaby I Need Your Loving\u201d in 1964, made them stars and their sixties track record on the label is indispensable to any retrospective of the decade. Their songs, soulful and bittersweet, were across-the-board successes. \u201cI Can\u2019t Help Myself (Sugar Pie, Honey Bunch),\u201d a No. 1 R&B and Pop smash in 1965, is one of Motown\u2019s longest-running chart toppers. Their commercial peak was highlighted by a romantic trilogy: the No. 1 \u201cReach Out I\u2019ll Be There,\u201d \u201cStanding In The Shadows Of Love\u201d (No. 2 R&B/no. 6 pop) and \u201cBernadette\u201d (No. 3 R&B/No. 4 pop).With 24 Top 40 pop hits to their credit, the Four Tops were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall Of Fame in 1990.Previous Event Next Event",

Advance tickets will also be on sale electronically via\u00a0Eventbrite\u00a0and in person with NO FEES at\u00a0Finnegan\u2019s Wake\u00a0Irish Pub.When\u00a0Sidelong,\u00a0Sarah Shook & the Disarmers\u2019 debut album, was released in early 2017, it quickly earned kudos for its blast of fresh, fierce honesty and sly wit. It was a welcome new voice in a genre too often mired in the staid and conventional. And while that record may have come to many as a surprise,\u00a0Years\u00a0solidifies the point: Sarah Shook & the Disarmers have moved from getting people\u2019s attention to commanding it. The album\u2013with its\u00a0sharpened songwriting, unique perspective, deepened sound and roll-up-your-sleeves attitude\u2013will grab you by the collar and put a defiant finger to your chest. It is resolute, blunt, and unflinching.Inspired by artists such as the Sex Pistols, Elliott Smith and Hank Williams, Sarah sings with confidence, control, and, at times, a hint of menace.\u00a0The Disarmers match her on every track, coloring the tales of resilience and empathy with as much urgency as ever as well as a broader sonic sweep. It\u2019s easy to hear Sarah as a close cousin to artists like\u00a0Hurray for the Riff Raff\u00a0and\u00a0Margo Price\u00a0on the title track, or in the country-\u201860s mod vibe on \u201cLesson.\u201d \u201cGood as Gold,\u201d sporting a kiss-off line for the ages,\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re as good as gold/ I\u2019m as good as gone,\u201d\u00a0is\u00a0both vulnerable and defiant, soaring with pop-inflected harmonies.\u00a0And with an expansiveness evoking the wide-open West, \u201cWhat it Takes\u201d speaks to the truth of the record, to her life, and to the universe.At its pounding heart,\u00a0Years\u00a0crackles with a pointedly contemporary and relevant take on the outlaw spirit. Built around the\u00a0buoyant pedal steel\u00a0of Phil Sullivan, and the\u00a0post-punk rattleand\u00a0Live at San Quentin\u00a0hum\u00a0of Eric Peterson\u2019s guitar, there are echoes of\u00a0Nikki Lane\u00a0and\u00a0Merle Haggard\u00a0as much as\u00a0Ty Segall.\u00a0Its home is the ragged-but-real\u00a0honky tonk,\u00a0not the bro-country \u201chonky tonk.\u201d The barroom singalong \u201cNew Ways to Fail\u201d is classic, smile-through-the-pain country. \u201cDamned If I Do\u201d could be the \u201cDrivin\u2019 Nails in My Coffin\u201d of the 21st century, if we let it; a perfect song for rolling in the wry and sneaking in a quick two-step. The sinister \u201cThe Bottle Never Lets Me Down\u201d will get anyone who\u2019s ever been wronged righteously flipping the bird as they knock back the next shot. Therapy in the face of personal devastation takes many forms, after all.As Sarah herself tells it\u2026\u201cThis record is about finding a way. A way through exhaustion, depression, betrayal, hangover after hangover, upper after downer after upper, fight after never-ending fight. It\u2019s about picking yourself up and dusting yourself off after years of being trampled and beaten down, jutting your chin out, head high, after they\u2019ve done their worst, and saying, \u201cStill here.\u201dThis record is shouting \u201cf**k you, I do want I want\u201d from the rooftops to the mother******g cosmos.\u201dLearn More About the Artist:Sarah Shook & The Disarmers:\u00a0Official Website\u00a0|\u00a0Facebook\u00a0|\u00a0Youtube\u00a0|\u00a0Instagram\u00a0|\u00a0Twitter"

An essential component of the original Motown machine\u2014that amazing engine invented by Berry Gordy\u2014The Temps began their musical life in Detroit in the early sixties. It wasn\u2019t until 1964, however, that the Smokey Robinson written-and-produced \u201cThe Way You Do the Things You Do\u201d turned the guys into stars.Their first Motown hit, \u201cBaby I Need Your Loving\u201d in 1964, made them stars and their sixties track record on the label is indispensable to any retrospective of the decade. Their songs, soulful and bittersweet, were across-the-board successes. \u201cI Can\u2019t Help Myself (Sugar Pie, Honey Bunch),\u201d a No. 1 R&B and Pop smash in 1965, is one of Motown\u2019s longest-running chart toppers. Their commercial peak was highlighted by a romantic trilogy: the No. 1 \u201cReach Out I\u2019ll Be There,\u201d \u201cStanding In The Shadows Of Love\u201d (No. 2 R&B/no. 6 pop) and \u201cBernadette\u201d (No. 3 R&B/No. 4 pop)."

    "notes": "For centuries scientists and engineers have worked within the limitations of the natural world to expand the palette on which musicians can create. This symbiotic relationship is not always widely appreciated, and is symptomatic of much more fundamental connections between science and art that extend into many arenas. Both science and art are driven by intuition and creativity, and both allow genius to express itself in the context of artificial or natural \u201crules\u201d. Understanding the physical nature of music illuminates the beauty of this creative process. Music, science and engineering are connected at many levels. I will use live keyboard demonstrations to illuminate how the origin of some musical styles, particularly blues piano, can be found in fundamental properties of sound and music. In particular, I will focus on the evolution of the scale and its impact on harmony and melody in western music.Murray Gibson became the Dean of the FAMU-FSU College of Engineering in 2016. \u00a0He grew up in the United Kingdom and holds a PhD in Physics from the University of Cambridge. He has a long career in industry and academia and has been Head of the Electronics and Photonics Materials Research Department at Bell Laboratories, \u00a0Associate Director of the Argonne National Laboratory, Professor at the University of Illinois in Urbana Champaign, and Founding Dean of the College of Science at Northeastern University. Gibson\u2019s \u00a0research has focused on the understanding of atomic structure in nanomaterials, and how it influences physical properties. \u00a0He has published over 200 papers, holds several patents and is a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the Royal Microscopical Society and the American Physical Society.

    "notes": "Since 2008 the Bach Parley has been performing primarily on period instruments, that is, harpsichord and baroque style stringed instruments with gut strings. The group focuses on music of Johann Sebastian Bach, his contemporaries, as well as pieces written before J. S. Bach was born with music written in the years 1600-1750.Performing on period-style instruments, the Bach Parley offers unique, exceptional concert experiences to educate and engage our community. We present Baroque music as it was performed hundreds of years ago with a fresh, accessible sound for today\u2019s audiences. The French word \u201cparley\u201d means discussion and a key element of Bach Parley concerts is the commentary provided by Music Director Valerie Arsenault who gives historical context about the composers and offers suggestions about what to listen for in the music.The Tallahassee Bach Parley is also the umbrella organization for a non-profit music school. In 2015, four teachers united to teach violin, viola, and cello at the Bach Parley String Academy at St. John\u2019s Episcopal church, and now the Academy has grown to six teachers, almost 100 students, and even offers ukulele classes.At all Sunday Tallahassee Bach Parley concerts this season, patrons will receive an insert in their programs with a discount coupon to use after the concert at participating downtown area restaurants. A $10 donation is suggested, and free childcare will be offered. The Bach Parley will hold their annual membership reception after the concert.For additional information about the Tallahassee Bach Parley, including the Bach Parley String Academy music school, visit www.bachparley.org.Enjoy the music, the venue, and the magic of Baroque performance with the Tallahassee Bach Parley!Don\u2019t miss our annual membership reception after the concert\u2026"
