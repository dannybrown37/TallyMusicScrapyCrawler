    "notes": "In 2012, Izzard was a college dropout living in Orlando, pursuing music full time. The release of the debut single \u201cHole in One\u201d solidified him as an authentic indie-blues artist, earning a loyal underground following. He continued to study the roots of blues and soul music, reinventing his style and reemerging as N.W. Izzard.In 2015, N.W. reconnected with hometown friend Tyler Watts, who was on the tail end of producing an adventure travel documentary, where Izzard was a featured artist on the soundtrack. Sharing a common vision, they began exchanging original songs and ideas while listening to their favorite blues records. In a few days time, songs like Howlin\u2019 Out, Sun\u2019s Gonna Shine and Down to Ride were born. Izzard introduced Watts to the art of busking, performing in the streets of North Central Florida before moving aboard Tyler\u2019s 46\u2019 sailboat and relocating to the Florida Keys. The duo spent the remainder of 2015 writing songs, playing the streets and refining their sound.During that time, another childhood friend, Nathan Ranew, saw the N.W. Izzard duo performing at a music festival and convinced the boys to move to Jax Beach, where there was more opportunities for original music. In 2016, they \u201chit the ground running\u201d earning residencies at Lynch\u2019s Irish Pub and other local venues, playing memorable performances at the infamous Freebird Live and continuing to build their cult-like following. Upon the release of their debut album \u201cNo Sleep\u201d, the band was evolving from a 2 piece into a power trio as Nate transitioned from manger to bass player, and from local stand outs to regional touring artists. The new addition brought forward a new sound and subsequently a new name, The Honey Hounds were born.Following the 2017 release of their EP \u201cMidnight Magic\u201d, the Honey Hounds continue to reenergize western music, embodying the rock n roll lifestyle while embracing the roots of soul and funk. Balancing between righteousness and the mysticism that surrounds the blues culture, they\u2019ve come to represent the resurgence of a genre and the voice of a generation.Currently the boys are touring and playing festivals though out the U.S. and preparing to record their next album.Learn More About the Artist:HONEY HOUNDS: Official Website |\u00a0Facebook\u00a0| Instagram | Spotify",

    "notes": "The Mountain Dew Clogging organization is a family oriented group comprised of people of all ages from all of the counties surrounding Tallahassee.Clogging gives you the opportunity to get out and enjoy a great social activity and get fit at the same time. Your legs will tone up very quickly. Clogging improves flexibility, coordination, endurance and strength. It increases lung capacity, relieves stress, and it\u2019s aerobic and burns fat. Clogging is usually danced in lines because there is a better social group feeling when you can see that your new friends are dancing the same routines as you. Some couple and partner routines are taught to keep in touch with the historic Appalachian clogging styles.The instructors teach both the steps and the routines. During classes the instructors cue or call all routines every time they are danced during the learning phase. This means once you know the steps at a given level, you can quickly join in with routines you have never seen.You will find you dance many and varied routines to pretty much all types of music, although country and top 100 current tunes are the most popular.Taps are a double jingle tap ordered from one of our suppliers. The sound of all the taps beating to the music, gets everybody tapping to the rhythms. In clogging the heel tap is used to give a strong regular beat during most steps.Like other worthwhile sporting activities, to progress quickly you may need to practice more than once a week at class. The good news is you can practice anywhere.",

The six songs (five new originals and a cover of Dylan\u2019s \u201cA Hard Rain\u2019s A-Gonna Fall\u201d) were recorded as mostly single-take, live performances in a room where instruments bled into vocal mics and vocals into instruments. The result is a raw and deeply vulnerable collection songs that follow Maloney\u2019s literate and often heartbreaking exploration of family history, childhood dreams and the adulthood realities that butt-up against them; loss, misogyny, unrequited love, poverty, and even the moral dilemma of sending monkeys into space for the sake of science. The daughter of a psychotherapist and a carpenter, Heather\u2019s songwriting is equal parts introspective and relatable."

This all instrumental strings concert will also include a sonata for violin and viola by Georg Philipp Telemann, the sublime Sonata in D major for violin by Georg Muffat. To simultaneously celebrate the joy and abandon of the season of Carnival and mourn its passing into the more serious season of Lent we will play a Serenata by Johan Heinrich Schmeltzer.Performed on period instruments, this all strings concert of 17th and 18th century music will feature Valerie Arsenault and Carrie Holden on baroque violins, Melissa Brewer and Brian Arsenault on baroque violas, plus cellist Kim Jones, bassist Melanie Punter, and harpsichordist Charles Brewer in the continuo section.The French word \u201cparley\u201d means discussion, and a key element of Bach Parley concerts is the commentary provided by Arsenault who gives historical context about the composers and offers suggestions about what to listen for in the music. The Tallahassee Bach Parley is also the umbrella organization for a non- profit music school, The Bach Parley String Academy. In 2015, four teachers united to teach violin, viola, and cello at St. John\u2019s Episcopal church, and now the String Academy has grown to six teachers, almost 100 students, and even offers ukulele classes.The concert will be at 3PM on Sunday, January 27 at St. John\u2019s Episcopal Church, 211 North Monroe Street. At all Sunday Tallahassee Bach Parley concerts this season, patrons will receive an insert in their programs with a discount coupon to use after the concert at participating downtown area restaurants. A $10 donation is suggested, and free childcare will be offered.For additional information about the Tallahassee Bach Parley, including the Bach Parley String Academy music school, visit www.bachparley.org.Facebook event here"

No refunds or exchanges of ticket purchases. Advance tickets will also be on sale electronically via Eventbrite and in person with NO FEES at\u00a0Finnegan\u2019s Wake\u00a0Irish Pub.When\u00a0Sidelong,\u00a0Sarah Shook & the Disarmers\u2019 debut album, was released in early 2017, it quickly earned kudos for its blast of fresh, fierce honesty and sly wit. It was a welcome new voice in a genre too often mired in the staid and conventional. And while that record may have come to many as a surprise,\u00a0Years\u00a0solidifies the point: Sarah Shook & the Disarmers have moved from getting people\u2019s attention to commanding it. The album\u2013with its\u00a0sharpened songwriting, unique perspective, deepened sound and roll-up-your-sleeves attitude\u2013will grab you by the collar and put a defiant finger to your chest. It is resolute, blunt, and unflinching.Inspired by artists such as the Sex Pistols, Elliott Smith and Hank Williams, Sarah sings with confidence, control, and, at times, a hint of menace.\u00a0The Disarmers match her on every track, coloring the tales of resilience and empathy with as much urgency as ever as well as a broader sonic sweep.\u00a0It\u2019s easy to hear Sarah as a close cousin to artists like\u00a0Hurray for the Riff Raff\u00a0and\u00a0Margo Price\u00a0on the title track, or in the country-\u201860s mod vibe on \u201cLesson.\u201d \u201cGood as Gold,\u201d sporting a kiss-off line for the ages,\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re as good as gold/ I\u2019m as good as gone,\u201d\u00a0is\u00a0both vulnerable and defiant, soaring with pop-inflected harmonies.\u00a0And with an expansiveness evoking the wide-open West, \u201cWhat it Takes\u201d speaks to the truth of the record, to her life, and to the universe.At its pounding heart,\u00a0Years\u00a0crackles with a pointedly contemporary and relevant take on the outlaw spirit. Built around the\u00a0buoyant pedal steel\u00a0of Phil Sullivan, and the\u00a0post-punk rattle\u00a0and\u00a0Live at San Quentin\u00a0hum\u00a0of Eric Peterson\u2019s guitar, there are echoes of\u00a0Nikki Lane\u00a0and\u00a0Merle Haggard\u00a0as much as\u00a0Ty Segall.\u00a0Its home is the ragged-but-real\u00a0honky tonk,\u00a0not the bro-country \u201chonky tonk.\u201d The barroom singalong \u201cNew Ways to Fail\u201d is classic, smile-through-the-pain country.\u00a0\u201cDamned If I Do\u201d could be the \u201cDrivin\u2019 Nails in My Coffin\u201d of the 21st century, if we let it; a perfect song for rolling in the wry and sneaking in a quick two-step.\u00a0The sinister \u201cThe Bottle Never Lets Me Down\u201d will get anyone who\u2019s ever been wronged righteously flipping the bird as they knock back the next shot. Therapy in the face of personal devastation takes many forms, after all.As Sarah herself tells it\u2026\u201cThis record is about finding a way.\u00a0 A way through exhaustion, depression, betrayal, hangover after hangover, upper after downer after upper, fight after never-ending fight.\u00a0 It\u2019s about picking yourself up and dusting yourself off after years of being trampled and beaten down, jutting your chin out, head high, after they\u2019ve done their worst, and saying, \u201cStill here.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0This record is shouting \u201cf**k you, I do want I want\u201d from the rooftops to the mother******g cosmos.\u201dLearn More About the Artist:Sarah Shook & The Disarmers:\u00a0Official Website\u00a0|\u00a0Facebook\u00a0|\u00a0Youtube\u00a0| Instagram |\u00a0TwitterOnce Great Estate:\u00a0Official Website\u00a0|\u00a0Facebook\u00a0",

Characters of depth, integrity and humanity are portrayed unlike anything else in theater today. The performance is a series of scenes taken from everyday life and set to beautiful music by composers such as Beethoven, Vivaldi, Strauss, and Copland. Through a combination of virtuoso manipulation, humor, pathos, classic music, and poetic insight, The Cashore Marionettes take the audience on a journey that celebrates the richness of life.Joseph Cashore has received numerous awards for his artistry including a Pew Fellowship for Performance Art, based upon his artistic accomplishment; a Henson Foundation Grant, an award intended to promote puppetry to adult audiences; and a Citation of Excellence from the North American Center of Union Internationale de la Marionnette (UNIMA-USA), the highest honor an American puppeteer can receive. UNIMA is the oldest international theatre organization in the world, founded in 1929.Previous Event Next Event",

    "notes": "Since forming in 2006, Presidio Brass has rocketed to success as the face of a bold new\u00a0generation in brass entertainment. By combining a brass quintet, piano and percussion\u00a0instruments with fresh, original arrangements, their unique sound has become a trademark for the ensemble from San Diego, California, captivating audiences everywhere. In 2017 they\u00a0partnered with the music education giant KHS America/XO Brass/Jupiter Musical Instruments, making them them the flagship ensemble of Jupiter Musical Instrument and performing exclusively on XO Brass instruments.Through their touring show of Hollywood\u2019s greatest hits, Sounds of the Cinema, these five\u00a0young men present film music with a good dose of wit and humor that together have become\u00a0hallmarks of every Presidio Brass performance. Audiences and music critics agree, Sounds of\u00a0the Cinema is \u201cTwo Thumbs Up\u201d and a \u201cMust See!\u201d The show has been enjoyed internationally, with performances and educational outreach programs throughout North America and China.\u00a0 Presidio Brass has performed in over 44 states, conducted master classes at many of America\u2019s finest colleges and universities, and been featured on National Public Radio.Each member of the ensemble began his music career by joining his school\u2019s band program.\u00a0 Inspired by the dedication of their school music teachers, Presidio Brass came together with the primary mission to promote music education and music appreciation in youngsters. This is why at every opportunity, performances are coupled with a master class or school program.\u00a0 Members of the Presidio Brass have performed with major symphony orchestras, including the Los Angeles Philharmonic and San Diego Symphony, and have shared the stage with commercial and pop artists that include Stevie Wonder, John Williams, Quincy Jones, Yo Yo Ma and more. When not on tour, they continue to perform with orchestras, maintain private teaching studios at local universities, arrange and compose new music, and assist with public school music programs. The Presidio Brass has released four recordings: Stolen Moments, a collection of popular classical and jazz selections, Christmas Day, an assortment of well-loved holiday favorites, Sounds of the Cinema, which includes pieces from their signature stage performance of the same name, and their newest release Rhapsody in Brass, featuring popular American music influenced by classical and jazz idioms."

    "notes": "Hailing from Richmond, VA, The Trongone Band is touring in support of their 2017 debut album, \u201cKeys to the House\u201d, released on Harmonized Records. With a sound that Paste Magazine likens to the \u201cfreak-outs of My Morning Jacket with the Muscle Shoals-inspired Leslie speakers and The Band\u2019s narrative storytelling\u201d, The Trongone Band is turning heads and making an impact on the Southern Rock \u2018n\u2019 Soul and Americana scenes.Formed by brothers Andrew and Johnny Trongone with father John Sr on bass, The Trongone Band (tron-GO-knee) has grown from a family affair to a full on touring machine with the addition of keyboardist Ben \u201cWolfe\u201d White and bassist Chip Hale. In the words of Live for Live Music, \u201cthe quartet has come together to create an old-school and all-in-the-family sound reminiscent of The Allman Brothers while still keeping it fresh with their cutting edge original compositions that also infuse funk and blues into the mix.\u201dKeeping with the homegrown vibe, the band nestled into the woods outside of RVA, tapping into Montrose Recording\u2019s Flickinger console, one of only seven remaining in the world. Known as the console that revolutionized the recording industry in the 60s & 70s, the Flickinger provided the warm sounds that turned into \u201cKeys to the House\u201d and brought to life what MusicFestNews described as \u201cimagery of boxcar drifters, rolling hills and dirt roads that are easy to close your eyes and get lost in\u201d.Summer and Fall of 2017 saw The Trongone Band taking \u201cKeys to the House\u201d on the road while touring in support of stalwarts including Umphrey\u2019s McGee, Reckless Kelly, American Aquarium and Cris Jacobs. Having graced the stages of Virginia\u2019s Roosterwalk and FloydFest, Tennessee\u2019s Riverbend Music Festival, The Allman Brothers\u2019 Peach Festival in Pennsylvania, Atlanta\u2019s Sweetwater 420 Fest and Macon\u2019s \u201cBig House Presents Summer Jam\u201d, the band is primed for a busy 2018 festival season and their first full European Tour. This four-piece ensemble may not all be related, but with a chemistry so emphatically discernible, it\u2019s fair to call them brothers.Learn More About the Artist:THE TRONGONE BAND: Official Website | Facebook\u00a0",

    "notes": "For centuries scientists and engineers have worked within the limitations of the natural world to expand the palette on which musicians can create. This symbiotic relationship is not always widely appreciated, and is symptomatic of much more fundamental connections between science and art that extend into many arenas. Both science and art are driven by intuition and creativity, and both allow genius to express itself in the context of artificial or natural \u201crules\u201d. Understanding the physical nature of music illuminates the beauty of this creative process. Music, science and engineering are connected at many levels. I will use live keyboard demonstrations to illuminate how the origin of some musical styles, particularly blues piano, can be found in fundamental properties of sound and music. In particular, I will focus on the evolution of the scale and its impact on harmony and melody in western music.Murray Gibson became the Dean of the FAMU-FSU College of Engineering in 2016. \u00a0He grew up in the United Kingdom and holds a PhD in Physics from the University of Cambridge. He has a long career in industry and academia and has been Head of the Electronics and Photonics Materials Research Department at Bell Laboratories, \u00a0Associate Director of the Argonne National Laboratory, Professor at the University of Illinois in Urbana Champaign, and Founding Dean of the College of Science at Northeastern University. Gibson\u2019s \u00a0research has focused on the understanding of atomic structure in nanomaterials, and how it influences physical properties. \u00a0He has published over 200 papers, holds several patents and is a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the Royal Microscopical Society and the American Physical Society. His hobbies include playing the piano."

    "notes": "Doors: 8PM | Music: 9:30PM\nNo Cover | Ages 21+ OnlyWhen Jeremy Pinnell released OH/KY in the summer of 2015 to stunned acclaim, it felt like an entire career compressed into one knock-out album. Hailed as a \u201cming-blowingly good\u201d (Greg Vandy, KEXP) \u201ctutorial on classic country music\u201d (Popmatters), Pinnell\u2019s debut immediately differentiated as authentic and unflinching. Dogged touring through Europe and the states and celebrated radio sessions followed, cementing Pinnell\u2019s position as a no-fuss master of his craft.His 2017 album Ties of Blood and Affection presents a canny lateral move.\u00a0\u00a0Instead of doubling down on the stark themes and values of his debut, this sophomore album finds Pinnell finding comfort in his own skin and achieving the redemption only hinted at in his previous batch of haunted songs.\u00a0\u00a0Here Pinnell joyfully embraces the working life, family obligations, and faith.\u00a0\u00a0His new stories delve into acceptance and survival, all the while investigating his most challenging chapter yet: adulthood. \u00a0While \u201cIf life don\u2019t get any better / I\u2019m alright with this\u201d isn\u2019t an out-right triumph, it\u2019s an honest revelation.You can feel the room breathe and get a sense of these musicians eyeballing each other as their performances are committed directly to thick analog tape. Honest and careworn, Jeremy\u2019s voice can touch on wry, jubilant, and debauched \u2013 all in a single line. Ties of Blood and Affection offers a fair dose resolution to Jeremy\u2019s story. At his best, Jeremy Pinnell chronicles the joy and sorrow of being human, which is the best that anyone could do.LEARN MORE ABOUT THE ARTIST:JEREMY PINELL: Official Website |\u00a0Facebook\u00a0| Instagram | Youtube\u201cHardscrabble honky-tonk at its best, nodding to Johnny Cash and Buck Owens in equal measure. Ties of Blood and Affection is a stellar collection that could earn Pinnell comparisons to Sturgill Simpson.\u201d \u2013 ROLLING STONE\u201cOne of my favorite new finds.\u201d \u2013 Sean Moeller / DAYTROTTER\u201cKentuckian Jeremy Pinnell hits all the country-tune sweet spots. His voice is strong and a little mournful \u2014 you can feel his ache seep through the speakers as you\u00a0listen\u00a0\u2014 and the rhythm section shuffles along gently. Weepy pedal steel licks feel just right as Pinnell sings a regretful refrain of \u2018I did it again,\u2019 a familiar sentiment for any of us who\u2019ve ever done a little backsliding.\u201d \u2013 THE BLUEGRASS SITUATION",

His guitar playing has been featured on three Grammy\u00ae-nominated albums, including the soundtrack of the Academy-Award winning film The Descendants.Makana\u2019s captivating and wide-ranging performance style has led him to share the stage with Jason Mraz and Jack Johnson, open for music legends Sting, Carlos Santana and Elvis Costello, and perform in venues ranging from Asian and European opera houses to The White House.Born and raised in Hawai\u2019i, Makana grew up on the shores of Waikiki amid the diversity of such legends as Don Ho and Bruno Mars. Makana \u2014 whose name means \u201ca gift given freely\u201d \u2014 began singing when he was 7 years old, took up ukulele at 9 and began learning the ancient art of slack key at 11.

His reputation as the youngest virtuoso\u00a0of slack key spread like molten volcanic lava throughout the islands.The focus of Makana\u2019s art is to celebrate the beauty of tradition while exploring new, relevant perceptions, sounds and themes. In his music he often honors his forebearers, the vintage Hawaiian music legends as well as the rock poet idols of the \u201960s, paying homage to the kupuna (elders) who carry within their Beings the cultural wisdom passed down through generations.Previous Event Next Event",

The band, who originally cut their teeth playing the oyster bars and listening rooms of the Florida Panhandle, has since written and released two full-length albums: their studio debut Follow (2014), called \u201ceye-opening, but warmly familiar\u201d by Earmilk, and whose title track is \u201cone of the most beautiful pieces of music I\u2019ve ever heard\u201d (Todd Moe of NCPR); and sophomore effort West of Here (2016), with its \u201ctight-as-a-rubber-band\u201d harmonies and \u201cinfectious\u201d songwriting (PopMatters).For their third album, This Side of the Glass (2019), The Currys teamed up with producer/guitarist Sam Whedon and engineer Stewart Myers (Jason Mraz, Parachute) to map new terrain. As ever, the band\u2019s three-part family harmonies provide the organic, lived-in feel of roots music, but the album aspires to a greater variety of tone, form, and orchestration than earlier releases. The songs defy categorization into any one genre: the country nostalgia of \u201cGulf Coast Home\u201d complements the folk-pop sensibility of \u201cPin You Down,\u201d while the guitars and gang vocals of \u201cSoon Enough\u201d pay unmistakable homage to Paul Simon\u2019s \u201cGraceland.\u201dLyrically, This Side of the Glass explores questions of perspective, an apt consideration for a band featuring three songwriters. Each Curry offers his take on the time-worn threads of life and love, contributing to the album\u2019s tapestry of introspection and social commentary. Likewise, each in turn ruminates on the paradox faced by every performing songwriter: how to balance one\u2019s roles as both the author of stories and the object of storytelling. This Side of the Glass is an insightful and satisfying new chapter from a band with many more stories to tell.The Currys kick off the This Side of the Glass tour in early March, joined by Whedon on guitar and supported by Sebastian Green (drums) and Alex Rees (keys, organ).Our kitchen will also be open for the evening from 6pm until 9:30pm, giving you plenty of time to enjoy a delicious meal during the show!This night will be packed, so grab a ticket before they\u2019re gone!

Bernard Hermann and Erich Korngold were both master film-score composers, and although the latter\u2019s Violin Concerto was not specifically written for the cinema, it deeply inhabits the sound world of the silver screen. Holst\u2019s iconic The Planets, which he described as \u201ca series of mood pictures,\u201d was born from the composer\u2019s fleeting interest in astrology, and has become one of the most oft-performed and beloved orchestral pieces.Featuring violinist, William HagenHermann, Vertigo Suite\nKorngold, Violin Concerto, Op. 35\nHolst, The Planets, Op. 32Sponsored by: Bank of America & Capital Eurocars"

    "headliner": "Bach Parley Spring Concert & Annual Reception",
    "notes": "Since 2008 the Bach Parley has been performing primarily on period instruments, that is, harpsichord and baroque style stringed instruments with gut strings. The group focuses on music of Johann Sebastian Bach, his contemporaries, as well as pieces written before J. S. Bach was born with music written in the years 1600-1750.Performing on period-style instruments, the Bach Parley offers unique, exceptional concert experiences to educate and engage our community. We present Baroque music as it was performed hundreds of years ago with a fresh, accessible sound for today\u2019s audiences. The French word \u201cparley\u201d means discussion and a key element of Bach Parley concerts is the commentary provided by Music Director Valerie Arsenault who gives historical context about the composers and offers suggestions about what to listen for in the music.The Tallahassee Bach Parley is also the umbrella organization for a non-profit music school. In 2015, four teachers united to teach violin, viola, and cello at the Bach Parley String Academy at St. John\u2019s Episcopal church, and now the Academy has grown to six teachers, almost 100 students, and even offers ukulele classes.At all Sunday Tallahassee Bach Parley concerts this season, patrons will receive an insert in their programs with a discount coupon to use after the concert at participating downtown area restaurants. A $10 donation is suggested, and free childcare will be offered. The Bach Parley will hold their annual membership reception after the concert.For additional information about the Tallahassee Bach Parley, including the Bach Parley String Academy music school, visit www.bachparley.org.Enjoy the music, the venue, and the magic of Baroque performance with the Tallahassee Bach Parley!Don\u2019t miss our annual membership reception after the concert\u2026"
