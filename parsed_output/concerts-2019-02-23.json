Your legs will tone up very quickly. Clogging improves flexibility, coordination, endurance and strength. It increases lung capacity, relieves stress, and it\u2019s aerobic and burns fat. Clogging is usually danced in lines because there is a better social group feeling when you can see that your new friends are dancing the same routines as you. Some couple and partner routines are taught to keep in touch with the historic Appalachian clogging styles.The instructors teach both the steps and the routines. During classes the instructors cue or call all routines every time they are danced during the learning phase. This means once you know the steps at a given level, you can quickly join in with routines you have never seen.You will find you dance many and varied routines to pretty much all types of music, although country and top 100 current tunes are the most popular.Taps are a double jingle tap ordered from one of our suppliers. The sound of all the taps beating to the music, gets everybody tapping to the rhythms. In clogging the heel tap is used to give a strong regular beat during most steps.Like other worthwhile sporting activities, to progress quickly you may need to practice more than once a week at class. The good news is you can practice anywhere.",

Advance tickets will also be on sale electronically via Eventbrite and in person with NO FEES at\u00a0Finnegan\u2019s Wake\u00a0Irish Pub.Known for their captivating blend of rock & roll and country, The Black Lillies have become one of Americana music\u2019s biggest success stories: an internationally-renowned band of roots-rockers, armed with songs that blur the boundaries between genres. They are a mainstay on radio and album sales charts, with a sound that is as powerful in the quieter moments as it is explosive during the jubilant ones.The band\u2019s pared down configuration has resulted in a bigger, deeper sound built on undeniable chemistry, lush three-part harmonies, and instrumental virtuosity with a funky edge. Their new album Stranger to Me, was an immediate critical and fan success, debuting at #5 on the Billboard Folk/Americana chart, #9 on the Billboard Current Country chart, and #61 on the Billboard Top 200 Albums chart \u2013no small feat for a band that eschews record labels in order to remain independent and in control of their sound. And what a sound it is: built on the foundation of the familiar roots rock of some of the greatest bands of the past, but altogether fresh, modern, sharp; swirling with psychedelic overtones, torch ballad longing, and an indie rock edge.Don\u2019t miss their long-awaited return to the Mainstage, with local support from the Flathead String Band!Learn More About the Artist:THE BLACK LILLIES:\u00a0Official Website\u00a0|\u00a0Youtube\u00a0|\u00a0Facebook\u00a0|\u00a0Instagram\u00a0|\u00a0Twitter\u00a0| BandcampFLATHEAD STRING BAND: Official Website | Facebook",

Hailed as a \u201cming-blowingly good\u201d (Greg Vandy, KEXP) \u201ctutorial on classic country music\u201d (Popmatters), Pinnell\u2019s debut immediately differentiated as authentic and unflinching. Dogged touring through Europe and the states and celebrated radio sessions followed, cementing Pinnell\u2019s position as a no-fuss master of his craft.His 2017 album Ties of Blood and Affection presents a canny lateral move.\u00a0\u00a0Instead of doubling down on the stark themes and values of his debut, this sophomore album finds Pinnell finding comfort in his own skin and achieving the redemption only hinted at in his previous batch of haunted songs.\u00a0\u00a0Here Pinnell joyfully embraces the working life, family obligations, and faith.\u00a0\u00a0His new stories delve into acceptance and survival, all the while investigating his most challenging chapter yet: adulthood. \u00a0While \u201cIf life don\u2019t get any better / I\u2019m alright with this\u201d isn\u2019t an out-right triumph, it\u2019s an honest revelation.You can feel the room breathe and get a sense of these musicians eyeballing each other as their performances are committed directly to thick analog tape. Honest and careworn, Jeremy\u2019s voice can touch on wry, jubilant, and debauched \u2013 all in a single line. Ties of Blood and Affection offers a fair dose resolution to Jeremy\u2019s story. At his best, Jeremy Pinnell chronicles the joy and sorrow of being human, which is the best that anyone could do.LEARN MORE ABOUT THE ARTIST:JEREMY PINELL: Official Website |\u00a0Facebook\u00a0| Instagram | Youtube\u201cHardscrabble honky-tonk at its best, nodding to Johnny Cash and Buck Owens in equal measure. Ties of Blood and Affection is a stellar collection that could earn Pinnell comparisons to Sturgill Simpson.\u201d \u2013 ROLLING STONE\u201cOne of my favorite new finds.\u201d \u2013 Sean Moeller / DAYTROTTER\u201cKentuckian Jeremy Pinnell hits all the country-tune sweet spots. His voice is strong and a little mournful \u2014 you can feel his ache seep through the speakers as you\u00a0listen\u00a0\u2014 and the rhythm section shuffles along gently. Weepy pedal steel licks feel just right as Pinnell sings a regretful refrain of \u2018I did it again,\u2019 a familiar sentiment for any of us who\u2019ve ever done a little backsliding.\u201d \u2013 THE BLUEGRASS SITUATION",

Slack key or Ki Ho\u2019alu, which is nearly 200 years old and indigenous to Hawai\u2019i, was created by \u2018ohana (families) on the different islands as a very personal folk music expression of their beautiful surroundings and way of life.\u00a0Makana has dedicated his life to perpetuating as well as evolving the traditional Hawaiian art form.The style is characterized by \u201cslacking\u201d the strings to open chords, thus freeing the hands to alter the sound whilst self-accompanying with a triad of alternating bass patterns, faux rhythms and sweet melodies evocative of island atmospheres. Think \u201cthree guitars in one!\u201d From this tradition Makana has evolved his own dynamic, high-octane style, coined \u201cSlack Rock\u201d: slack key infused with elements of bluegrass, rock, blues and raga.\u00a0Makana\u2019s playing has garnered praise from such guitar luminaries as Kirk Hammett (Metallica) and Pepe Romero (Spanish Flamenco Master). He is considered one of the \u201cgreatest living players\u201d (Esquire Magazine) whose \u201cinstrumental brilliance bears comparison with the work of such groundbreaking acoustic guitarists as John Fahey and Michael Hedges\u201d (Maui News).Previous Event Next Event",

The Melody Trucks Band came together in early 2017 as she encountered each member within this extended musical family.\u00a0\u00a0Their individual styles and influences run the entire span of every music genre: rock, blues, jazz, funk, classical, country, thrash metal, and even world music. This has culminated in fresh and unique interpretations of iconic songs from the genre of Melody\u2019s extended family.Collectively, the members of the group have shared the stage with The Allman Brothers, Derek Trucks, Willie Nelson, Vaylor Trucks, Lee Boys, Butch Trucks and the Freight Train, Devon Allman, Duane Trucks, Bonnie Bramlett, Roosevelt Collier, John Popper, Bruce Katz, Ben Sparaco, JJ Grey and Mofro, and countless others.JUke is a four-piece, \u201cpost-blues,\u201d hybrid with a high motor and bottomless soul.\nSpearheaded by frontman/harmonica-whiz/singer, Eric Garcia, JUke\u2019s content touches on non-traditional subject matter while simultaneously keeping their crowd moving with a smile on their faces. The addition of Sonny East on guitar, Korian Hannah on the drums, and Marcel Salas now have the band firing on all cylinders. JUke\u2019s high-energy live performances and imaginative lyrical depth have thrilled music fans at festivals such as Wanee, Hulaween, AURA, Magnolia Fest, and Orange Blossom Jamboree.

Lord\u2019s second album \u201cHangdog Heaven\u201d, released on the Blue Vinyl Records label in March 2000 and produced by Ken Pine and Larry Gates, was characterized by the New York Post as a \u201c\u2026dozen-song man-and-a-guitar disc [that] freely crosses the borders of folk rock, contemporary country and old-fashioned jazz guitar.\u201d\nInfluences include Bert Jansch, Ralph McTell, James Taylor, Leonard Cohen and Tom Waits.We\u2019ll also be offering $1 off all local craft drafts for the night so come out and join the fun!LEARN MORE ABOUT THE ARTIST:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/JimLordSingerSongwriter/\nhttps://www.jimlord.com/"

The band, who originally cut their teeth playing the oyster bars and listening rooms of the Florida Panhandle, has since written and released two full-length albums: their studio debut Follow (2014), called \u201ceye-opening, but warmly familiar\u201d by Earmilk, and whose title track is \u201cone of the most beautiful pieces of music I\u2019ve ever heard\u201d (Todd Moe of NCPR); and sophomore effort West of Here (2016), with its \u201ctight-as-a-rubber-band\u201d harmonies and \u201cinfectious\u201d songwriting (PopMatters).For their third album, This Side of the Glass (2019), The Currys teamed up with producer/guitarist Sam Whedon and engineer Stewart Myers (Jason Mraz, Parachute) to map new terrain. As ever, the band\u2019s three-part family harmonies provide the organic, lived-in feel of roots music, but the album aspires to a greater variety of tone, form, and orchestration than earlier releases. The songs defy categorization into any one genre: the country nostalgia of \u201cGulf Coast Home\u201d complements the folk-pop sensibility of \u201cPin You Down,\u201d while the guitars and gang vocals of \u201cSoon Enough\u201d pay unmistakable homage to Paul Simon\u2019s \u201cGraceland.\u201dLyrically, This Side of the Glass explores questions of perspective, an apt consideration for a band featuring three songwriters. Each Curry offers his take on the time-worn threads of life and love, contributing to the album\u2019s tapestry of introspection and social commentary. Likewise, each in turn ruminates on the paradox faced by every performing songwriter: how to balance one\u2019s roles as both the author of stories and the object of storytelling. This Side of the Glass is an insightful and satisfying new chapter from a band with many more stories to tell.The Currys kick off the This Side of the Glass tour in early March, joined by Whedon on guitar and supported by Sebastian Green (drums) and Alex Rees (keys, organ).Our kitchen will also be open for the evening from 6pm until 9:30pm, giving you plenty of time to enjoy a delicious meal during the show!This night will be packed, so grab a ticket before they\u2019re gone!

His curiosity took him to southern Spain in search of flamenco roots and to South America, exploring various musical styles of Latin jazz. Developing an interest in Swing, he began composing Swing materials that he has combined with Latin music.Daniel\u2019s unique guitar style has made him a landmark musician in Germany\u2019s Jazz scene. His sound encompasses jazz, pop and classical music. He began playing classical guitar at the age of 8 and was soon introduced to jazz, rock and pop music. His music speaks for itself; the elaborate instrumentation is the essence.In 2016, Daniel released Live in der Stadtkirche, a \u201clive\u201d CD with Lulo, which instantly became \u201cRecord of the Month\u201d in the German NDR Jazz Charts.Previous Event Next Event",

His numerous accolades include the prestigious Ivor Novella International Award (2012) and the Academy of Country Music\u2019s Poet Award (2016). In 2016 Rolling Stone magazine listed Webb as one of the top 50 songwriters of all time. Jimmy Webb was the youngest person ever inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame and served as its chairman.Glen Campbell and Jimmy Webb were an unexpected pairing: a multi-platinum recording-artist arch conservative; and, a child-prodigy, long-hair stoner songwriter. Yet, Campbell and Webb became one of the most successful musical collaborations of all time.

But then, you remember her songs and her playing. And it hits you: brash, beautiful originality is exactly what Molly is doing.The 2017 release of her debut EP Rise further introduced Molly to a roots music audience who had already enthusiastically embraced and elevated her. Her 2017 and 2018 wins for Guitar Player of the Year from the International Bluegrass Association (IBMA) were history-making, as the first woman to be nominated for the honor, and the accolades have kept coming in 2018 with Folk Alliance International\u00a0awarding her\u00a0\u201c\u00a0Song of the Year\u201d for\u00a0\u201cYou Didn\u2019t Call My Name\u201d during the\u00a0International Folk Music Awards.

In between tours, she has been hard at work in the studio crafting her eagerly-anticipated debut album with producer/engineer Ryan Hewitt (Avett Brothers, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Lumineers), which will be released in early 2019 on Compass Records.Previous Event Next Event",

No refunds or exchanges of ticket purchases. Advance tickets will also be on sale electronically via Eventbrite and in person with NO FEES at\u00a0Finnegan\u2019s Wake\u00a0Irish Pub.This incredible trio was created by Detroit native and internationally acclaimed percussionist Gerald Cleaver, in collaboration with Larry Ochs, founder of the legendary Rova Saxophone Quartet. With the addition in 2015 of experimental guitar icon Nels Cline (who belatedly became a pop-guitar icon by joining Wilco) the trio\u2019s lineup was complete.NELS CLINE might be as close as the modern avant-garde gets to a household name. Before joining indie rock institution Wilco in 2004, Cline divided his energy between improvised contexts alongside Julius Hemphill, Vinny Golia, and brother Alex, and more song-oriented settings like Carla Bozulich\u2019s alt-country outfit Geraldine Fibbers and Mike Watt\u2019s Crew of the Flying Saucer. Cline continues to occupy the narrow space between pure sound and song, as exemplified by his longstanding Singers trio with drummer Scott Amendola and bassist Trevor Dunn, and his recent duo with guitar prodigy Julian Lage.\u00a0www.nelscline.comIn his own words, Detroit-bred, New York-based GERALD CLEAVER\u2019s multifaceted approach to the drum set balances \u201cstatic sound and extreme dynamics, melodicism within heavy texture, deep-rooted groove, unchained abandon, and the power and revelation of recurring form.\u201d Cleaver made a name for himself through enduring partnerships with Vision Fest regulars like Roscoe Mitchell and Charles Gayle, but lately critics have been abuzz about his new musique concr\u00e8te-cum-free rock quintet Black Host with Darius Jones, Cooper-Moore, Brandon Seabrook, and Pascal Niggenkemper. Pitchfork\u2019s Hank Shteamer described 2013\u2019s Life in the Sugar Candle Mines as, \u201ca well-tended hot-house: feverish and bracingly weird, yet also purposeful and shrewdly strategic.\u201dLARRY OCHS is best known as a founder of the Rova Sax Quartet, a San Francisco institution that pioneered the application of improvisational strategies within the context of contemporary composition, beginning in the late 1970s and continuing right up to the present day: 40 years old in 2018. Equally inspired by modernist 20th century composition and the more worldly, abrasive strands of 60s free jazz, Rova and Ochs became widely celebrated for the lengths they would go to stretch the performance parameters of notated music through early collaborations with Henry Kaiser, Fred Frith, and John Zorn. Ochs connection with Cline began in the late 1990\u2019s and culminated with the Celestial Septet, a septet comprised of both the Rova Sax Quartet and the Nels Cline Singers, with a fantastic CD release including a long, ecstatic Ochs composition and tours from 2009 \u2013 2011. Ochs and Cleaver have performed off and on as a duo since 2013; a duo CD release (coming in 2018) \u2013 a beautiful , haunting set of music called \u201cSongs of the Wild Cave\u201d \u2013 will document their 2016 live recording made inside a secret cave in the Dordogne area of France; a cave that contains upwards of 150 Pleistocene-era paintings. It\u2019s a unique recording in which the cave itself seriously influenced the music, becoming essentially the third member of a trio.\u00a0www.ochs.ccLearn More About the Artist:NELS CLINE \u2013 GERALD CLEAVER \u2013 LARRY OCHS:\u00a0Official Website",

    "notes": "Since 2008 the Bach Parley has been performing primarily on period instruments, that is, harpsichord and baroque style stringed instruments with gut strings. The group focuses on music of Johann Sebastian Bach, his contemporaries, as well as pieces written before J. S. Bach was born with music written in the years 1600-1750.Performing on period-style instruments, the Bach Parley offers unique, exceptional concert experiences to educate and engage our community. We present Baroque music as it was performed hundreds of years ago with a fresh, accessible sound for today\u2019s audiences. The French word \u201cparley\u201d means discussion and a key element of Bach Parley concerts is the commentary provided by Music Director Valerie Arsenault who gives historical context about the composers and offers suggestions about what to listen for in the music.The Tallahassee Bach Parley is also the umbrella organization for a non-profit music school. In 2015, four teachers united to teach violin, viola, and cello at the Bach Parley String Academy at St. John\u2019s Episcopal church, and now the Academy has grown to six teachers, almost 100 students, and even offers ukulele classes.At all Sunday Tallahassee Bach Parley concerts this season, patrons will receive an insert in their programs with a discount coupon to use after the concert at participating downtown area restaurants. A $10 donation is suggested, and free childcare will be offered. The Bach Parley will hold their annual membership reception after the concert.For additional information about the Tallahassee Bach Parley, including the Bach Parley String Academy music school, visit www.bachparley.org.Enjoy the music, the venue, and the magic of Baroque performance with the Tallahassee Bach Parley!Don\u2019t miss our annual membership reception after the concert\u2026"
