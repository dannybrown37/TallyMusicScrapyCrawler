Hundreds of shows a year in more than 40 different states and on three different continents, including visits to Ireland and Malaysia, have brought them to the 10 stormy tracks that make up\u00a0Hail Mary, which will be released June 28th.Now three albums and nearly 10 years into their career, Shane Smith & the Saints are ready to go for broke. \u201cIt pretty much summarizes where we are as a band and where I am as an individual after pursuing this for practically the last decade,\u201d Smith says of\u00a0Hail Mary. \u201cWe\u2019re a scrappy group of guys and this is more or less one of those moments where we\u2019re really trying to put it all out there. We\u2019re trying to give it our best shot on this record.\u201dRecorded at the same hometown studio as\u00a0Geronimo, Matt Noveskey (of Blue October)\u2019s Orb Recording Studio,\u00a0Hail Mary\u00a0was produced by Mark Needham (Imagine Dragons, The Killers), marking the first time the band has worked with an outside producer. Inspired by Shane Smith & the Saints\u2019 reputation as a high-energy live act with stunning four-part harmonies, Needham focused on capturing that un-doctored chemistry in the studio.\u201cA lot of these songs he had us in there with Shure SM58 microphones, live, in front of each one of the guys. He\u2019d be actually using it for the final song rather than going in and overdubbing every single voice, which is a very rare thing,\u201d says Smith of the sessions, which were largely tracked live in the studio. \u201cThat gave us a little more confidence hearing him build us up on that whole thing.\u201dThat extra self-assuredness comes through in each of Smith\u2019s roaring vocals and in the band\u2019s stampeding melodies. From the crunching title track to the slow burn of\u00a0\u201cOklahoma City\u201d\u00a0to the triumphant blaze of glory that is\u00a0\u201cParliament Smoke,\u201d\u00a0Hail Mary\u00a0crosses the gritty, blue-collar storytelling of Bruce Springsteen with the singsong hooks of Mumford & Sons. Most of all, it\u2019s an album with a lot of heart.\u201cI don\u2019t like just throwing stuff out there. If I\u2019m going to be singing about something every night, I try to make it personal, make it something I can really relate to,\u201d says Smith, the band\u2019s lyricist and primary songwriter. \u201cI like to sing with conviction, an honest conviction.\u201d Having first starting playing music while he attended college in Austin, Smith follows in the footsteps of such Lone Star songsmiths as Ray Wylie Hubbard, Hayes Carll, and Ryan Bingham.A native of Terrell, Texas, about an hour outside of Dallas, Smith first headed to Tyler Junior College in East Texas, where he was part of the tennis program. But he was soon lured to the \u201cLive Music Capital of the World,\u201d where he attended St. Edwards University and soon connected with another group of players, those who now make up the Saints. Today that group includes Bennett Brown on fiddle, Dustin Schaefer on lead guitar, Chase Satterwhite on bass, and Zach Stover on drums.Much like the care that Smith puts into his lyrics, the Saints have been deliberate in crafting their recorded material. Their first album, Coast, was released in 2013, and featured appearances by fellow Texas underdogs Aaron Watson and Ryan Engleman. Two years later came\u00a0Geronimo, which Smith sees carrying a similar sort of double meaning to\u00a0Hail Mary. \u201cThe title track did talk a lot about the historical figure, but it was a leap of faith thing as well, where we were as a band truly trying to find our sound,\u201d he says of the band\u2019s sophomore effort.Shane Smith & the Saints\u2019 busy touring schedule meant that almost three years elapsed after\u00a0Geronimo\u2018s release before they had the time to start recording\u00a0Hail Mary. Even when the album had been completed, now more than a year ago, they were careful not to rush its release. As in the past, that will be done through Geronimo West Records, the label Smith runs with his wife.\u201cIt\u2019s been such a long time coming. And honestly, for me, it\u2019s such a personal album in terms of the lyrical content, what the band has gone through and the band\u2019s families have gone through over the years,\u201d Smith says. \u201cIt means a lot to me, I know it means a lot to the guys, and I wanted to make sure we gave it good legs to stand on.\u201dThough Smith and his bandmates have been the ones logging in the miles in their \u201cCousin Eddie-looking\u201d RV, their friends, family, and other loved ones are the ties that bind together the songs on\u00a0Hail Mary. \u201cThe last couple years of doing this stuff I\u2019ve started to realize how much of a sacrifice it is for those outside characters. A lot of my lyrics are paying tribute to those people and the fact that we wouldn\u2019t be able to do this if it wasn\u2019t for them,\u201d says Smith. \u201cA lot of people paint [the music business] as a glamorous thing, but it\u2019s truly difficult to pull off if you have any intention of being a family man.\u201dLucky for them, Shane Smith & the Saints\u2019 family has only grown through their tireless touring in recent years. Having long been grouped in with the sprawling, grassroots genres of Texas Country and Red Dirt music, Smith says that fanbase is uniquely suited to their own single-minded approach.\u201cIt\u2019s a massive network of people that are music lovers, but they\u2019re not like your standard music lover. They\u2019re so passionate that they not only support the music, they show it to every one of their friends and promote it for you,\u201d Smith marvels. \u201cIt\u2019s a support system of people who want to hear really good music, but a lot of the time get frustrated with what they hear on the radio.\u201dWith\u00a0Hail Mary, those fans will have their best representation yet of the barnstorming concerts that likely drew them to Shane Smith & the Saints in the first place. \u201cAfter four years of touring and sweat equity, it\u2019s significantly helped and changed our sound,\u201d Smith says. \u201cBut the really cool thing is that, as our sound has truly started going away even further from what the norm is in Texas Country and Red Dirt, that same group of people is jumping on board now more than ever before.\u201dHeaven knows Shane Smith & the Saints have earned that loyalty.\u00a0More about the bands\nShane Smith & the Saints:\u00a0 Website\u00a0 \u00a0|\u00a0 \u00a0Facebook\u00a0 \u00a0|\u00a0 \u00a0Instagram\u00a0 \u00a0| \u00a0 Twitter\u00a0 \u00a0|\u00a0 \u00a0YouTube\u00a0 \u00a0|\u00a0 \u00a0SpotifyOnce Great Estate:\u00a0 Website\u00a0 \u00a0| \u00a0\u00a0Bandcamp\u00a0 \u00a0|\u00a0 \u00a0Facebook\u00a0 \u00a0|\u00a0 \u00a0Instagram\u00a0 \u00a0|\u00a0 \u00a0YouTube\u00a0 \u00a0|\u00a0 \u00a0Spotify\u00a0",

This recreates for our audiences the experience of hearing and seeing Baroque music as it may have been originally performed hundreds of years ago while generating a fresh sound immediately accessible to listeners today. The Bach Parley is made up of experienced musicians who are trained in historically informed performance, mainly local professional performers and teachers, and FSU faculty and students. Many Bach Parley musicians also perform in Baroque music groups around the country, such as in Atlanta, New York, Texas, and Boston.The word \u201cparley\u201d in French means discussion and a key element of Tallahassee Bach Parley concerts is the commentary offered by our music director to engage and enlighten our audience. These dialogues give the audience a historical background about the composers and their world and suggest what to listen for in the music. This entertaining and light-hearted educational commentary connects the audience with what the musicians are playing, lifts barriers between performers and listeners, and creates a relaxed concert atmosphere with an informed and engaged audience.Other programs include \u201cKids Go For B\u2019roque,\u201d a competition and honors concert featuring talented young musicians from the community performing the music of the Baroque period. We also run the Bach Parley String Academy and offer lessons on violin, viola, and cello as well as ukulele classes."

    "notes": "Violinist/fiddler and composer Andrew Finn Magill grew up studying fiddle from the best fiddlers in the world every summer at the The Swannanoa Gathering in Asheville, North Carolina. Since age 18 he has been featured multiple times on NPR and has released seven albums in styles ranging from traditional Irish music to Afro-pop. He is a Fulbright Fellow, 2019 North Carolina Arts Council fellow, and Ropeadope recording artist. In 2014, Finn moved to Rio de Janeiro where he studied Brazilian choro music with Nicolas Krassik and Luis Barcelos among others. He has shared the stage with grammy-nominated Trio Brasileiro, Brazilian Strings Trio (which he founded with fellow American violinist Ted Falcon and Brazilian guitarist Nando Duarte) and Canta, Violino! Canta Violinos self-titled album was released on Ropeadope Records in 2018 and features some of the most exciting virtuosi of Brazil's next generation including Louren\u00e7o Vasconcellos (drums), Jo\u00e3o Camarero (7-string guitar), Dudu Oliveira (flute), Fernanda Sant'Anna (vocals) as well as American mandolin god Mike Marshall. Says Brazilian percussion legend Airto Moreira of Chick Corea and Miles Davis: \"It's nice to see fresh, young musicians carrying on the traditions of Brazilian music. Finn Magill displays a love and authenticity that can fool you into thinking he is from Brazil. His style is playful and light, yet soulful and passionate. Congratulations!\" Fluent in both Portuguese and French, and passionate for Brazilian music education, Finn has taught workshops on choro and Brazilian music for violin in the U.S., Brazil, and France including the Fairbanks Summer Arts Festival, Montana Fiddle Camp, The Swannanoa Gatherings Fiddle Week, and Le S\u00e9jour de Cl\u00e9gu\u00e9rec in France.

Join the band of swashbuckling buccaneers, bumbling British bobbies, frolicsome Victorian maidens, and the delightfully dotty \u201cmodel of a modern Major- General\u201d for a rollicking romp over the rocky coast of Cornwall.

The rich sounds of full orchestra, chorus, and legitimate vocal soloists resonate with classic elegance and power while the company\u2019s vibrancy, energy and contemporary sense of humor keep the show alive and exciting to a modern audience.

    "notes": "In 2012, Izzard was a college dropout living in Orlando, pursuing music full time. The release of the debut single \u201cHole in One\u201d solidified him as an authentic indie-blues artist, earning a loyal underground following. He continued to study the roots of blues and soul music, reinventing his style and reemerging as N.W. Izzard.In 2015, N.W. reconnected with hometown friend Tyler Watts, who was on the tail end of producing an adventure travel documentary, where Izzard was a featured artist on the soundtrack. Sharing a common vision, they began exchanging original songs and ideas while listening to their favorite blues records. In a few days time, songs like Howlin\u2019 Out, Sun\u2019s Gonna Shine and Down to Ride were born. Izzard introduced Watts to the art of busking, performing in the streets of North Central Florida before moving aboard Tyler\u2019s 46\u2019 sailboat and relocating to the Florida Keys. The duo spent the remainder of 2015 writing songs, playing the streets and refining their sound.During that time, another childhood friend, Nathan Ranew, saw the N.W. Izzard duo performing at a music festival and convinced the boys to move to Jax Beach, where there was more opportunities for original music. In 2016, they \u201chit the ground running\u201d earning residencies at Lynch\u2019s Irish Pub and other local venues, playing memorable performances at the infamous Freebird Live and continuing to build their cult-like following. Upon the release of their debut album \u201cNo Sleep\u201d, the band was evolving from a 2 piece into a power trio as Nate transitioned from manger to bass player, and from local stand outs to regional touring artists. The new addition brought forward a new sound and subsequently a new name, The Honey Hounds were born.Following the 2017 release of their EP \u201cMidnight Magic\u201d, the Honey Hounds continue to reenergize western music, embodying the rock n roll lifestyle while embracing the roots of soul and funk. Balancing between righteousness and the mysticism that surrounds the blues culture, they\u2019ve come to represent the resurgence of a genre and the voice of a generation.Currently the boys are touring and playing festivals though out the U.S. and preparing to record their next album.Learn More About the Artist:HONEY HOUNDS: Official Website |\u00a0Facebook\u00a0| Instagram | Spotify",

A player and maker of didgeridoos for over 20 years, Ramin will guide the novice and experienced didgeridoo player to explore new aspects of themselves and the instrument.Philosophy:\nThe didgeridoo, also known to the Aboriginal people of Australia as the yidaki, is one of the world\u2019s oldest instruments, used to channel the sound vibrations of the Earth, nature, and the cosmos. I deeply believe the application of these sacred sounds and vibrations can open us up for alignment to life force flow. Time and time again, I have experienced the positive effects that sound healing brings. My path is to share the medicine of sound with you so that you can apply it to your own path of personal development. Restoring ourselves enables us to bring greater love and light into all we do, and to realize our highest potential. As the great sage, Mohandas Gandhi taught, \u201cBe the change that you want to see in the world\u201d."

Stubblefield (keyboardist Rick Steff joined in 2006) started playing shows in Memphis. The band\u2019s first show was April 13, 1998 at a warehouse space across the street from what is now the National Civil Rights Museum, the infamous Lorraine Motel where Martin Luther King Jr. was shot. Their first set was six songs played to about six people. On August 3, 2018, record release day for Among the Ghosts, the band will be co-headlining Red Rocks Amphitheater in Colorado.The band\u2019s ninth studio album, Among the Ghosts, is their first for noted Nashville indie label Thirty Tigers. It was recorded and co-produced with Grammy-winning engineer/producer and Memphis native Matt Ross-Spang (Jason Isbell, Margo Price, Drive by Truckers) at the historic Sam Phillips Recording Service, the studio built by the legendary producer after outgrowing his Memphis Recording Service/Sun Studio.Recorded primarily live as a five-piece, Among the Ghosts eschews the Stax-inspired horns and Jerry Lee Lewis-style boogie piano featured on some of the band\u2019s past recordings for a streamlined rock & roll sound that pays homage to their seminal influences as it seeks to push that legacy into the future. For a band who carried the torch of the alt-country movement back in the 90\u2019s and helped pave the way for what is now called Americana, Lucero have re-discovered what inspired them in the first place. The sound is more their own and at the same time not exactly like anything they\u2019ve done before. This is a band settling into their craft. The 10-song disc\u2019s title is both a tribute to the spirits which roam the streets of their fabled city, as well as the hard road the determinedly independent band set out on 20 years ago. The band played around 200 shows per year for many of those 20 years.\u201cIt may have taken 20 years, but everything has fallen in place right where it needs to be,\u201d acknowledges Nichols. \u201cThere were some dark days in those middle years, but we\u2019ve learned how to do this and survive. We still write heartbreak songs, but now, with a family at home, it\u2019s a whole new kind of heartbreak.\u201d Among the Ghosts lays out that new territory with alacrity, as Lucero shines their Morning Star, burning just as brightly, if not more so, 20 years later. As one of the album\u2019s song titles so aptly puts it, \u201cEverything Has Changed\u201d, but one thing hasn\u2019t\u2026 Lucero\u2019s music remains more vital than ever.\u00a0Learn More About the Artists:LUCERO:\nOfficial Website\u00a0|\u00a0Facebook\u00a0|\u00a0Twitter\u00a0|\u00a0Instagram\u00a0|\u00a0Youtube",

    "notes": "The Tallahassee Bach Parley performs music of the Baroque era (approx. 1600-1750) using period instruments. This recreates for our audiences the experience of hearing and seeing Baroque music as it may have been originally performed hundreds of years ago while generating a fresh sound immediately accessible to listeners today. The Bach Parley is made up of experienced musicians who are trained in historically informed performance, mainly local professional performers and teachers, and FSU faculty and students. Many Bach Parley musicians also perform in Baroque music groups around the country, such as in Atlanta, New York, Texas, and Boston.The word \u201cparley\u201d in French means discussion and a key element of Tallahassee Bach Parley concerts is the commentary offered by our music director to engage and enlighten our audience. These dialogues give the audience a historical background about the composers and their world and suggest what to listen for in the music. This entertaining and light-hearted educational commentary connects the audience with what the musicians are playing, lifts barriers between performers and listeners, and creates a relaxed concert atmosphere with an informed and engaged audience.Other programs include \u201cKids Go For B\u2019roque,\u201d a competition and honors concert featuring talented young musicians from the community performing the music of the Baroque period. We also run the Bach Parley String Academy and offer lessons on violin, viola, and cello as well as ukulele classes."

It is a classic American tale of rags to riches. From humble beginnings picking cotton in the fields to international stars that went on to sell 80 million albums while changing the face and sound of country music.\u00a0Quality songs that have become the soundtrack for American life are the foundation for ALABAMA\u2019s stellar career. Alabama introduced rock style guitars, lights, pyrotechnics and sounds to the country audience that has inspired many of today's brightest country stars including Kenny Chesney, Jason Aldean and Luke Bryan.\u00a0While their music continues to stand the test of time, their numbers and stats are beyond compare. 50 years since starting the band, Alabama has charted 43 #1 singles including 21 #1 singles in a row and have won over 179 CMA Awards, Grammy Awards, and ACM Awards. They are members of the Country Music Hall of Fame and have their own star of the Hollywood Walk of Fame. They are also world-class philanthropists who have raised over 250 Million dollars for charity. Celebrate 50 years of ALABAMA on their 50th Anniversary Tour coming to the Donald L. Tucker Civic Center\u00a0on October 10th."
