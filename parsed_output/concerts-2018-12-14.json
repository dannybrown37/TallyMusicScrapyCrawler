The Melody Trucks Band came together in early 2017 as she encountered each member within this extended musical family. Their individual styles and influences run the entire span of every music genre: rock, blues, jazz, funk, classical, country, thrash metal, and even world music. This has culminated in fresh and unique interpretations of iconic songs from the genre of Melody\u2019s extended family.The members of the group have shared the stage with The Allman Brothers, Derek Trucks, Willie Nelson, Valor Trucks, Lee Boys, Butch Trucks and the Freight Train, Devon Allman, Duane Trucks, Bonnie Bramlett, Roosevelt Collier, John Popper, Bruce Katz, Ben Sparaco, JJ Grey and Mofro, and countless others.Support for this show will be The Bobby Lee Rodgers Jazz Trio, who takes one back to the Golden Decade when Jazz was the soul of the city. Along with playing his Jazz originals, during performances Bobby Lee Rodgers captures the sounds of the great artists of our time like Miles Davis, John Coltrane, Thelonious Monk and Wes Montgomery. He visits their compositions by putting his original vocabulary and sound into the harmonic structure of the songs.Bobby brings a unique sound to his performance because he plays through a combination of Leslie cabinet and vintage guitar amp which gives him the beautiful sound of an organ and guitar together. A stellar songwriter, vocalist and guitarist he fuses rock, funk, jazz and blues into a magical musical tapestry. He has performed with such great artists as Vassar Clements, Warren Haynes, Widespread Panic, George Porter Jr. and the list goes on and on. His new CD, BLR was just release to rave reviews. Whether playing his originals or capturing sound of the jazz culture, Bobby Lee Rodgers can truly be called one of the new modern day guitar greats.Learn More About the Artist:THE MELODY TRUCKS BAND: Official Website\u00a0|\u00a0Facebook\u00a0|\u00a0InstagramTHE BOBBY LEE RODGERS TRIO: Official Website\u00a0|\u00a0Facebook\u00a0| Youtube",

Gales picked up the guitar at age four and was playing in blues competitions by the age of 10. Although Gales plays a right-handed guitar \"upside-down\" (with the bass E string on the bottom), he is not naturally left-handed; he was taught by his brother, who is left-handed, and never second-guessed the untraditional technique.

Your legs will tone up very quickly. Clogging improves flexibility, coordination, endurance and strength. It increases lung capacity, relieves stress, and it\u2019s aerobic and burns fat. Clogging is usually danced in lines because there is a better social group feeling when you can see that your new friends are dancing the same routines as you. Some couple and partner routines are taught to keep in touch with the historic Appalachian clogging styles.The instructors teach both the steps and the routines. During classes the instructors cue or call all routines every time they are danced during the learning phase. This means once you know the steps at a given level, you can quickly join in with routines you have never seen.You will find you dance many and varied routines to pretty much all types of music, although country and top 100 current tunes are the most popular.Taps are a double jingle tap ordered from one of our suppliers. The sound of all the taps beating to the music, gets everybody tapping to the rhythms. In clogging the heel tap is used to give a strong regular beat during most steps.Like other worthwhile sporting activities, to progress quickly you may need to practice more than once a week at class. The good news is you can practice anywhere.",

There will be a White Elephant* gift exchange from 7-7:30, then we'll just keep playing until everyone gets tired & goes home -- or around 10 pm, whichever comes first!* A White Elephant Gift Exchange is a popular Christmas event where people vie to walk away with the best present. It also goes by \"Dirty Santa\" and other names. The White Elephant game is played by a lot of different rulesets  some dead simple and others confusingly elaborate. Here are the basic rules:1. Each player brings one wrapped gift to contribute to a common pool (value of $5 or less suggested)2. Players draw numbers to determine what order they will go in3. Players sit in a circle where they can see the gift pile4. The first player selects a gift from the pool and opens it where everyone can see it5. The following players can choose to either pick an unwrapped gift from the pool or steal a previous players gift. Anyone who gets their gift stolen in this way can do the same  choose a new gift or steal from someone else.6. After all players have had a turn, the first player gets a chance to swap the gift he or she is holding for any other opened gift. Anyone whose gift is stolen may steal from someone else (as long as that person hasnt been stolen from yet). When someone declines to steal a gift, the game comes to an end.",

    "notes": "An original musical written by the staff at Making Light Productions, Under the Rainbow is set in the bird sanctuary of Noah\u2019s Ark and opens with a \u201ccruise ship\u201d atmosphere, as the birds prepare to embark on what they think, at first, anyway, is an exciting journey. By the end of the upbeat Latin-themed opening number, 38 days have passed, and the birds are a little tired of cruising. The Counting Crows have lost count, the Mockingbird is getting on everyone\\\u2019s nerves, and no one has heard from the wise old owl. Even Red Robin Williams, the resident stand-up comic, finds his jokes falling flat.A Bat, traumatized by being forced to live with the mammals (lions and tigers and bears!) then tries to sneak into the bird sanctuary. The Dove, a kind-hearted bird with dreams of being a great explorer, immediately befriends the Bat, but the Raven calls him a \u201cfreak.\u201dUnder the Rainbow explores, through the magic of musical theatre, what it means to be different \u2014 and how our differences make us all stronger and more beautiful, both individually and as a group.\u00a0With appearances from Katy Parrot, the resident pop star, and\u00a0Blue Jay Z, along with the rap stylings of the Angry Birds, these avian adventurers learn, by the time this story is over,\u00a0that \u201cThe Sky Is the Limit,\u201d and their adventure has just begun."

    "notes": "In 2012, Izzard was a college dropout living in Orlando, pursuing music full time. The release of the debut single \u201cHole in One\u201d solidified him as an authentic indie-blues artist, earning a loyal underground following. He continued to study the roots of blues and soul music, reinventing his style and reemerging as N.W. Izzard.In 2015, N.W. reconnected with hometown friend Tyler Watts, who was on the tail end of producing an adventure travel documentary, where Izzard was a featured artist on the soundtrack. Sharing a common vision, they began exchanging original songs and ideas while listening to their favorite blues records. In a few days time, songs like Howlin\u2019 Out, Sun\u2019s Gonna Shine and Down to Ride were born. Izzard introduced Watts to the art of busking, performing in the streets of North Central Florida before moving aboard Tyler\u2019s 46\u2019 sailboat and relocating to the Florida Keys. The duo spent the remainder of 2015 writing songs, playing the streets and refining their sound.During that time, another childhood friend, Nathan Ranew, saw the N.W. Izzard duo performing at a music festival and convinced the boys to move to Jax Beach, where there was more opportunities for original music. In 2016, they \u201chit the ground running\u201d earning residencies at Lynch\u2019s Irish Pub and other local venues, playing memorable performances at the infamous Freebird Live and continuing to build their cult-like following. Upon the release of their debut album \u201cNo Sleep\u201d, the band was evolving from a 2 piece into a power trio as Nate transitioned from manger to bass player, and from local stand outs to regional touring artists. The new addition brought forward a new sound and subsequently a new name, The Honey Hounds were born.Following the 2017 release of their EP \u201cMidnight Magic\u201d, the Honey Hounds continue to reenergize western music, embodying the rock n roll lifestyle while embracing the roots of soul and funk. Balancing between righteousness and the mysticism that surrounds the blues culture, they\u2019ve come to represent the resurgence of a genre and the voice of a generation.Currently the boys are touring and playing festivals though out the U.S. and preparing to record their next album.Learn More About the Artist:HONEY HOUNDS: Official Website |\u00a0Facebook\u00a0| Instagram | Spotify",

    "notes": "Since 2008 the Bach Parley has been performing primarily on period instruments, that is, harpsichord and baroque style stringed instruments with gut strings. The group focuses on music of Johann Sebastian Bach, his contemporaries, as well as pieces written before J. S. Bach was born with music written in the years 1600-1750.Performing on period-style instruments, the Bach Parley offers unique, exceptional concert experiences to educate and engage our community. We present Baroque music as it was performed hundreds of years ago with a fresh, accessible sound for today\u2019s audiences. The French word \u201cparley\u201d means discussion and a key element of Bach Parley concerts is the commentary provided by Music Director Valerie Arsenault who gives historical context about the composers and offers suggestions about what to listen for in the music.The Tallahassee Bach Parley is also the umbrella organization for a non-profit music school. In 2015, four teachers united to teach violin, viola, and cello at the Bach Parley String Academy at St. John\u2019s Episcopal church, and now the Academy has grown to six teachers, almost 100 students, and even offers ukulele classes.At all Sunday Tallahassee Bach Parley concerts this season, patrons will receive an insert in their programs with a discount coupon to use after the concert at participating downtown area restaurants. A $10 donation is suggested, and free childcare will be offered. The Bach Parley will hold their annual membership reception after the concert.For additional information about the Tallahassee Bach Parley, including the Bach Parley String Academy music school, visit www.bachparley.org.Enjoy the music, the venue, and the magic of Baroque performance with the Tallahassee Bach Parley!"

No refunds or exchanges of ticket purchases. Advance tickets will also be on sale electronically via Eventbrite and in person with NO FEES at\u00a0Finnegan\u2019s Wake\u00a0Irish Pub.When\u00a0Sidelong,\u00a0Sarah Shook & the Disarmers\u2019 debut album, was released in early 2017, it quickly earned kudos for its blast of fresh, fierce honesty and sly wit. It was a welcome new voice in a genre too often mired in the staid and conventional. And while that record may have come to many as a surprise,\u00a0Years\u00a0solidifies the point: Sarah Shook & the Disarmers have moved from getting people\u2019s attention to commanding it. The album\u2013with its\u00a0sharpened songwriting, unique perspective, deepened sound and roll-up-your-sleeves attitude\u2013will grab you by the collar and put a defiant finger to your chest. It is resolute, blunt, and unflinching.Inspired by artists such as the Sex Pistols, Elliott Smith and Hank Williams, Sarah sings with confidence, control, and, at times, a hint of menace.\u00a0The Disarmers match her on every track, coloring the tales of resilience and empathy with as much urgency as ever as well as a broader sonic sweep.\u00a0It\u2019s easy to hear Sarah as a close cousin to artists like\u00a0Hurray for the Riff Raff\u00a0and\u00a0Margo Price\u00a0on the title track, or in the country-\u201860s mod vibe on \u201cLesson.\u201d \u201cGood as Gold,\u201d sporting a kiss-off line for the ages,\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re as good as gold/ I\u2019m as good as gone,\u201d\u00a0is\u00a0both vulnerable and defiant, soaring with pop-inflected harmonies.\u00a0And with an expansiveness evoking the wide-open West, \u201cWhat it Takes\u201d speaks to the truth of the record, to her life, and to the universe.At its pounding heart,\u00a0Years\u00a0crackles with a pointedly contemporary and relevant take on the outlaw spirit. Built around the\u00a0buoyant pedal steel\u00a0of Phil Sullivan, and the\u00a0post-punk rattle\u00a0and\u00a0Live at San Quentin\u00a0hum\u00a0of Eric Peterson\u2019s guitar, there are echoes of\u00a0Nikki Lane\u00a0and\u00a0Merle Haggard\u00a0as much as\u00a0Ty Segall.\u00a0Its home is the ragged-but-real\u00a0honky tonk,\u00a0not the bro-country \u201chonky tonk.\u201d The barroom singalong \u201cNew Ways to Fail\u201d is classic, smile-through-the-pain country.\u00a0\u201cDamned If I Do\u201d could be the \u201cDrivin\u2019 Nails in My Coffin\u201d of the 21st century, if we let it; a perfect song for rolling in the wry and sneaking in a quick two-step.\u00a0The sinister \u201cThe Bottle Never Lets Me Down\u201d will get anyone who\u2019s ever been wronged righteously flipping the bird as they knock back the next shot. Therapy in the face of personal devastation takes many forms, after all.As Sarah herself tells it\u2026\u201cThis record is about finding a way.\u00a0 A way through exhaustion, depression, betrayal, hangover after hangover, upper after downer after upper, fight after never-ending fight.\u00a0 It\u2019s about picking yourself up and dusting yourself off after years of being trampled and beaten down, jutting your chin out, head high, after they\u2019ve done their worst, and saying, \u201cStill here.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0This record is shouting \u201cf**k you, I do want I want\u201d from the rooftops to the mother******g cosmos.\u201dLearn More About the Artist:Sarah Shook & The Disarmers:\u00a0Official Website\u00a0|\u00a0Facebook\u00a0|\u00a0Youtube\u00a0| Instagram |\u00a0Twitter",

Characters of depth, integrity and humanity are portrayed unlike anything else in theater today. The performance is a series of scenes taken from everyday life and set to beautiful music by composers such as Beethoven, Vivaldi, Strauss, and Copland. Through a combination of virtuoso manipulation, humor, pathos, classic music, and poetic insight, The Cashore Marionettes take the audience on a journey that celebrates the richness of life.Joseph Cashore has received numerous awards for his artistry including a Pew Fellowship for Performance Art, based upon his artistic accomplishment; a Henson Foundation Grant, an award intended to promote puppetry to adult audiences; and a Citation of Excellence from the North American Center of Union Internationale de la Marionnette (UNIMA-USA), the highest honor an American puppeteer can receive.

In 2015, Farruquito was invited to dance with the LA Phil, in four sold-out gala concerts of an adapted version of Amor Brujo directed by Gustavo Dudamel at the Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles.

    "notes": "For centuries scientists and engineers have worked within the limitations of the natural world to expand the palette on which musicians can create. This symbiotic relationship is not always widely appreciated, and is symptomatic of much more fundamental connections between science and art that extend into many arenas. Both science and art are driven by intuition and creativity, and both allow genius to express itself in the context of artificial or natural \u201crules\u201d. Understanding the physical nature of music illuminates the beauty of this creative process. Music, science and engineering are connected at many levels. I will use live keyboard demonstrations to illuminate how the origin of some musical styles, particularly blues piano, can be found in fundamental properties of sound and music. In particular, I will focus on the evolution of the scale and its impact on harmony and melody in western music.Murray Gibson became the Dean of the FAMU-FSU College of Engineering in 2016. \u00a0He grew up in the United Kingdom and holds a PhD in Physics from the University of Cambridge. He has a long career in industry and academia and has been Head of the Electronics and Photonics Materials Research Department at Bell Laboratories, \u00a0Associate Director of the Argonne National Laboratory, Professor at the University of Illinois in Urbana Champaign, and Founding Dean of the College of Science at Northeastern University. Gibson\u2019s \u00a0research has focused on the understanding of atomic structure in nanomaterials, and how it influences physical properties. \u00a0He has published over 200 papers, holds several patents and is a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the Royal Microscopical Society and the American Physical Society.

    "notes": "Since 2008 the Bach Parley has been performing primarily on period instruments, that is, harpsichord and baroque style stringed instruments with gut strings. The group focuses on music of Johann Sebastian Bach, his contemporaries, as well as pieces written before J. S. Bach was born with music written in the years 1600-1750.Performing on period-style instruments, the Bach Parley offers unique, exceptional concert experiences to educate and engage our community. We present Baroque music as it was performed hundreds of years ago with a fresh, accessible sound for today\u2019s audiences. The French word \u201cparley\u201d means discussion and a key element of Bach Parley concerts is the commentary provided by Music Director Valerie Arsenault who gives historical context about the composers and offers suggestions about what to listen for in the music.The Tallahassee Bach Parley is also the umbrella organization for a non-profit music school. In 2015, four teachers united to teach violin, viola, and cello at the Bach Parley String Academy at St. John\u2019s Episcopal church, and now the Academy has grown to six teachers, almost 100 students, and even offers ukulele classes.At all Sunday Tallahassee Bach Parley concerts this season, patrons will receive an insert in their programs with a discount coupon to use after the concert at participating downtown area restaurants. A $10 donation is suggested, and free childcare will be offered. The Bach Parley will hold their annual membership reception after the concert.For additional information about the Tallahassee Bach Parley, including the Bach Parley String Academy music school, visit www.bachparley.org.Enjoy the music, the venue, and the magic of Baroque performance with the Tallahassee Bach Parley!Don\u2019t miss our annual membership reception after the concert\u2026"
