While still living in Boston, Medford had been recording and performing as a solo artist under the moniker Ian, an old high school nickname bestowed upon her by her skater friends. A last minute cancellation by a touring drummer in 2014 led her to work with Tim Cheney, with whom she quickly forged a creative connection and burgeoning friendship. By the time she recruited bassist Damien Scalise, the project had evolved from a solo endeavor to a trio, and they adopted the new name Ian Sweet. Musically complex, yet undeniably hooky, Medford's songs confronted themes of anxiety and panic with bright-toned guitar pop and references to Nickelodeon's Slime Time Live, Michael Jordan, and skateboarding. After settling in Brooklyn, the group signed with Hardly Art and released their self-titled debut EP in the summer of 2016. It was followed a few months later by Shapeshifter, their full-length debut.",

Your legs will tone up very quickly. Clogging improves flexibility, coordination, endurance and strength. It increases lung capacity, relieves stress, and it\u2019s aerobic and burns fat. Clogging is usually danced in lines because there is a better social group feeling when you can see that your new friends are dancing the same routines as you. Some couple and partner routines are taught to keep in touch with the historic Appalachian clogging styles.The instructors teach both the steps and the routines. During classes the instructors cue or call all routines every time they are danced during the learning phase. This means once you know the steps at a given level, you can quickly join in with routines you have never seen.You will find you dance many and varied routines to pretty much all types of music, although country and top 100 current tunes are the most popular.Taps are a double jingle tap ordered from one of our suppliers. The sound of all the taps beating to the music, gets everybody tapping to the rhythms. In clogging the heel tap is used to give a strong regular beat during most steps.Like other worthwhile sporting activities, to progress quickly you may need to practice more than once a week at class. The good news is you can practice anywhere.",

Parent involvement is crucial in this program! Suzuki instructors are registered with the Suzuki Association of the Americas and have completed extensive training in early childhood music education.Classes generally begin with \u201cmusic games:\u201d instrument holding simulations and lots of listening. Parents will be given a CD to listen to over and over again, at home, in the car, through the television, etc. Why this method?"

Bassist Jacob Theriot and guitarist Christian Theriot are brothers, forming the core trio with friend and vocalist Cale Chronister. Their '80s-influenced breezy indie pop sound informed much of their debut LP, Naked All the Time, which was recorded at Blackwatch Studio in Norman, Oklahoma, and released in late 2015.

After forty years and nearly 70+ of some of the greatest players seen anywhere, ELI has continually ripped up stages across the nation with their own blend of rock and roll with an attitude and a touch of the party!Their unique brand of showmanship and definitive musical skills brought them to the forefront as the tour opener for the mega-rock group KISS. Their amazing musical performances and over-the-top stage show have made them a crowd and club favorite for decades. Even forty years later, ELI is rocking harder than ever and continues to blow their thousands of longtime fans away and grab hold of new ones along the way!Learn More About The Artist:\nhttp://www.elirocks.com/\nhttps://www.facebook.com/EliBandOfficial/\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-sMdyt77yOclvf-dIAEoQA\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-sMdyt77yOclvf-dIAEoQA"

    "headliner": "The Jeff Jensen Band", 
    "notes": "Sometimes all it takes is a tiny spark to ignite a raging inferno. For Jeff Jensen, the spark occurred in 2011. Feeling the need for a fresh start, he loaded up his car to head back to his boyhood home in California. \u00a0Just as that journey was to begin, a deep and unexpected calling starting boiling inside, Jensen changed directions and headed to Memphis.\u00a0 There was no job waiting for him; no plan, no family, no band, just a lone friend with a temporary place for him to stay. But our intrepid guitar player felt it was the right move, the only move. \u00a0In less than thirty hours after arriving, he met Brandon Santini and was offered the opportunity to be his guitarist.\u00a0 Soon after, Jeff became music director for the Brandon Santini Band.The inferno has been building ever since. After two years, almost 500 shows and three recordings with Santini, Jensen re-formed his band with long-time friend and musical collaborator Bill Ruffino (bass).\u00a0 Then they recruited Memphis native Robinson Bridgeforth as drummer.\u00a0 They hit the road and never looked back.Most people are in for a shock the first time they experience a Jeff Jensen Band performance. It starts with the trio mixing an eccentric blend of soul, rock, and American roots music with a deep blues influence. \u00a0Suddenly Jensen feels the spirit, transforming into a whirling dervish of sight & sound as he bounds across the stage, barely able to contain himself as he wrenches stark, biting six-string explosions from his guitar. His passion is there for all to see, a rare occurrence in these times of buttoned-down music-making. \u00a0At first, the sheer emotional force he creates can be a bit overwhelming. Then you realize that all art is an expression of the soul, of the power of the life-giving force that created the universe. And Jeff feels it is his responsibility to make the effort to communicate his passion with each member of the audience every night.\u00a0 After all, music is art, and art is the physical form of emotion.In 2015, Jensen released the vibrant\u00a0Morose Elephant\u00a0album that captures the flavor of the band\u2019s creative force. Combining seven originals with covers of songs from Memphis Minnie and Amos Milburn plus a traditional gospel hymn, Jensen articulates the depth of his musical vision with help from a number of friends including Victor Wainwright, Reba Russell, and Annie Harris. The disc received even more critical acclaim as the band\u2019s previous release,\u00a0Road Worn and Ragged (2013), both produced by Jensen.\u00a0 This\u00a0led to two consecutive\u00a0Blues Blast Music Award\u00a0nominations in the\u00a0Sean Costello Rising Star\u00a0category (2014/2015).The band continues to tour the US, Canada and many European countries relentlessly, as the inferno shows no signs of burning out. Whenever there is a break in the schedule, Jensen switches roles, acting as the producer with other artists including Mick Kolassa, John Parker and co-producing \u00a0Santini\u2019s \u00a0This Time Another Year, nominated for a Blues Music Award in the Contemporary Blues Album category (2014)."

We mean, of course, Bach\u2019s stunning Magnificat in D major and Handel\u2019s timeless Messiah. Bach\u2019s setting of the Latin text of the story of the Virgin Mary as told by the Gospel of St. Luke is imbued with a sense of exultation, with every note designed to embellish the words and passages that challenge the technical mastery of the singers. The Christmas portion, as well as other selections from Handel\u2019s Messiah, perfectly round out the program, culminating with the great Hallelujah chorus. Begin your holiday season with exultation!Our Community Partner for this concert is Tallahassee Senior Center. Members from the Senior Center and its foundation will be in the lobby of the concert hall to visit with patrons, tell them about the Senior Center\u2019s holiday fundraiser, and help with ushering duties.Purchase your tickets on our website (or call 850-597-0603) and reserve your seats today!!TICKETS\n$22 general admission\n$18 senior\n$6 student*Box office opens at 2:30 pm the day of the concert**Add $2 to above prices for tickets purchased at the door day of the concert"

He was a minister, and he had this little flat-bodied guitar. It was electric, no amplifier to it. And he would bring it to the shop with him, and he was trying to learn how to play. So, I would get to the barbershop early whenever I would go to get my hair cut, or even after school, I would hang around at the barbershop, because I wanted to get my hands on that guitar. I would take the guitar and they had these old wooden benches. I would lay the guitar on top of the wooden bench and when you would strum the strings, the wood, the bench, would vibrate, and the floor would, the sound would resonate, and you could hear it without the amplifier. I learned just from watching him.\u201d Young Gilmore tried to keep his obsession with the instrument from his church going aunt, who was raising him, but word of the talented boy who played at the barbershop eventually got back to her.\u201dDecades later and established as a Florida legend, Joey Gilmore provides a highlight at Blues Festivals and night clubs all over the world as one of the best soul-blues and R&B singers in the business. Joey Gilmore has shared the stage with Such Greats As James Brown, Etta James, Bobby Bland, Little Milton, Johnny Taylor and numerous others. In January 2006 Joey Gilmore won one of the most distinguished and internationally coveted awards in all of blues. The IBC. Joey Gilmore outscored all artist worldwide while showcasing his amazing talent at a blues industry event. Making him the best unsigned Artist on the planet. In 2008 Joey Gilmore was awarded the Blewzzy award for best song, BLUES ALL OVER YOU.\u00a0 In 2015 Joey Gilmore was\u00a0honored with\u00a0Latin World Talent\u00a0Lifetime Achievement Award.\u00a0 He continues to soar in the music industry.In Jan. 2015, Joey released his new CD titled BRANDON\u2019S BLUES on Mosher St. Records.In Feb. 2016 Joey is releasing his next CD titled RESPECT THE BLUES on Mosher St. Records.Joey\u2019s outstanding band members.Joey Gilmore \u2013 Guitar and VocalsRobert\u00a0\u201cHi-Hat\u201d Carter \u2013 BassMaurice Dukes \u2013 DrumsSonny Boy Williams, KeyboardsDottie Kelly\u00a0\u2013 Vocals"

Starting with house parties and guest slots at small clubs, he quickly graduated to long residencies in several nightclubs. This resulted in a rise in exposure, to the point where he was invited to become the resident mix show DJ on Northern Ireland\u2019s number one-rated commercial radio station Cool FM. The station\u2019s Hiphop show, \u2018The Extended Weekend\u2019 was, at the time, the only urban show in the country.He can now be found behind the turntables at various radio stations across the United States, from New York City all the way down to Tallahassee, FL.\u00a0Dubbed \u2018The Deepest Crates in the 850\u2019 (Tallahassee\u2019s area code) he has an expansive library of music over multiple genres. Although Hiphop is his first love, he is equally comfortable spinning R\u2019n\u2019B, House, Reggae & Dancehall, Soul, Funk, Pop, and Latin music.He has opened for and toured with various artists across multiple genres \u2013 from Justin Timberlake, Christina Aguilera, and Britney Spears, to 50 Cent, KRS-One, Public Enemy, MC Lyte, Run DMC & The Beastie Boys, and Gang Starr, to Chocolate Puma, Diplo and Tiesto.

The band chose its name after the song \u2018The Ordinary Boys,\u2019 from Morrisey\u2019s debut album \u2018Viva Hate,\u2019 and as an homage to the concept behind \u2018The Smiths\u2019 name. The band performed its first show at the iconic Churchill\u2019s Pub in Miami, Florida. Initial approval from Smiths and Moz fans resulted in a string of regular apperances across Florida. The unexpected success that followed has made\u00a0Ordinary Boys\u00a0one of Florida\u2019s best kept secrets.In recent years, the band has evolved through several lineup changes, with an increased focus on perfectly emulating the sound of their Manchester heroes. This continuous evolution has taken the project to the next level, giving fans the ultimate The Smiths and Morrissey experience. Their fun and energetic sets includes such hits as \u2018How Soon is Now?\u2019, \u2018There is a Light\u2019, \u2018Irish Blood, English Heart\u2019, \u2018Ask\u2019, \u2018Big Mouth\u2019, \u2018Queen is Dead\u2019, \u2018Panic\u2019, \u2018This Charming Man\u2019, \u2018Suedehead\u2019 and lots more!

Clearly, Hanck has worshipped at the right Southern altars\u2013 those of such iconic R&B brothers as Fats Domino, Ray Charles, B. B. King, Lee Allen and King Curtis. \u201cI write songs that you think you\u2019ve heard for years,\u201d says the South Florida-based Hanck, who\u2019s got suave movie-star looks and a good time presence that immutably anchors the old-style R&B he adores.\u00a0"

The band chose its name after the song \u2018The Ordinary Boys,\u2019 from Morrisey\u2019s debut album \u2018Viva Hate,\u2019 and as an homage to the concept behind \u2018The Smiths\u2019 name. The band performed its first show at the iconic Churchill\u2019s Pub in Miami, Florida. Initial approval from Smiths and Moz fans resulted in a string of regular apperances across Florida. The unexpected success that followed has made Ordinary Boys one of Florida\u2019s best kept secrets.In recent years, the band has evolved through several lineup changes, with an increased focus on perfectly emulating the sound of their Manchester heroes. This continuous evolution has taken the project to the next level, giving fans the ultimate The Smiths and Morrissey experience. Their fun and energetic sets includes such hits as \u2018How Soon is Now?\u2019, \u2018There is a Light\u2019, \u2018Irish Blood, English Heart\u2019, \u2018Ask\u2019, \u2018Big Mouth\u2019, \u2018Queen is Dead\u2019, \u2018Panic\u2019, \u2018This Charming Man\u2019, \u2018Suedehead\u2019 and lots more!

Advance tickets will also be on sale with NO FEES at\u00a0Finnegan\u2019s Wake\u00a0Irish Pub.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Back in January, worn out from having spent a year on tour and facing a new album\u2019s release and another year spent mostly on a bus, away from the comforts of home and family, Patterson Hood decided to try to write a book. He had made a couple of stabs in that direction before (as well as a couple of screenplays) but had so far failed to complete one. The thing is, Patterson loves to write on the road. He writes most every day out there. It\u2019s usually not songs, as completing a song amid all of the noise, distractions and music blasting on the bus is very difficult (he does often start songs there that get finished later) but writing non-musical compositions comes pretty easy for him out there and it sure passes the time. Besides, he had an idea for a story he wanted to write and it started coming very easily. By their third month on the road Patterson already had a pretty firm outline of what he wanted and several chapters that he felt really good about.He was calling his book \u201cSlam Dancing in the Pews\u201d, named after a cassette that Virgil Kane had recorded in 1992 when Cooley and Patterson were playing shows under that name after the break up of Adam\u2019s House Cat. The book was basically half-assed fictionalization of that very turbulent period of Patterson\u2019s life. He was 27, his band broke up, he got divorced and left his hometown to live in Memphis. His car got stolen, the band\u2019s truck got stripped and he fell in love. He fell out with his family (who he was very, very close to) and had his heart broken. He seriously pondered killing himself several times but instead wrote literally over 500 songs in a three-year period. A time when he reinvented himself artistically and experienced a sort of rebirth that led to a lot of the things he has done in the last two decades.His book would sort of tell that story, but interspersed with lyrics from that period of his life, as well as new song lyrics either set in that time or from the point of view of various characters from the book. The structure would be chapter / song / chapter / song and so on. If the book was coming fast, the songs were coming even easier. Then the booked stopped coming. Someday he may want to tell that story, but timing is everything and this just isn\u2019t the time for it.The songs, however continued to pour out, taking a few left turns and then morphing into its own thing. Most of this album comes from that short period of time between February and June of 2011. The songs begin in the period that the book was set in, but don\u2019t end there, as they really just were the impetus for writing about the life he is living now and contrasting it with the troubled times of two decades ago.Patterson Hood called it Heat Lightning Rumbles in the Distance and decided that spring to record it as a solo album. He could clearly hear in his head exactly how he wanted every song to sound and made a list of who he wanted to play on each one. It is in some ways the most personal album Patterson has ever made. There has always been a lot of Patterson in all of the albums they\u2019ve done, but usually semi-disguised as character sketches and stories, but the first person narrative in this one is pretty firmly rooted in autobiography, albeit in two dramatically differing time periods.A Festival of Teeth \u2013 The making of Heat Lightning:David Hood is a session bass player who played on tons of those great Muscle Shoals soul classics back in the day. He played bass on The Staple Singers\u2019 classic \u201cI\u2019ll Take You There\u201d as well as hits by Aretha Franklin, Wilson Pickett, Bobby Womack, Bob Seger, Paul Simon, Willie Nelson and Etta James. He is also Patterson\u2019s dad and he came over to record with him last fall and absolutely outdid himself. His playing on the title cut is just stunning.David Barbe, who has partnered with Patterson on almost everything he\u2019s done for about a decade now, co-produced and played bass on the rest of the album.Kelly Hogan has long been one of Patterson\u2019s favorite people and he knew he wanted her to sing on the album. She has just recently recorded an album of her own and she and Patterson had attempted to co-write a song for it. She sent him a set of lyrics to an unfinished song she was working on about our friend Vic Chesnutt. He loved her lyrics and set about re-writing it and turning it into a song called \u201cCome Back Little Star\u201d which Patterson then sent back to her to complete, but alas she didn\u2019t get it finished in time to make her album and upon deciding to do his album, asked her if he could finish it for the album and she agreed. She came down to Georgia and sang on it and on \u201cAfter The Damage\u201d which Patterson also wrote with her voice in mind. Upon singing her takes she could see through the glass into the control room what she described as \u201cA Festival of Teeth.\u201dAs always, Brad Morgan played drums and just keeps getting better and better all of the time. As a lot of the songs were piano based, Patterson feels he was was fortunate to have Jay Gonzalez playing Andy Baker\u2019s grand piano (on indefinite loan to Chase Park Transduction) as well as Wurlitzer, accordion and Mellotron. John Neff came by to play some spot-on pedal steel and they even got Cooley in to play banjo on a couple of tracks.Patterson\u2019s love for the Denton, Texas band Centro-matic is well known and once again he felt fortunate to have Will Johnson and Scott Danbom in for a few days each to play with him. Will came in October, played some guitar and did some stunning singing. Scott came by in August and played upright piano on \u201cLeaving Time\u201d, then came back in early December and played the fiddle. Patterson had always heard cello on some of these songs and for the first time got to play with Jacob Morris (Madeline, Moths and Old Smokey).In the end, they made the most intimate and personal record of Patterson\u2019s career. He has put together a really phenomenal band, The Downtown Rumblers, to go out and tour behind it and we\u2019re more than thrilled to welcome them to our Mainstage right here in Tallahassee, FL.

Although Gales plays a right-handed guitar \"upside-down\" (with the bass E string on the bottom), he is not naturally left-handed; he was taught by his brother, who is left-handed, and never second-guessed the untraditional technique. This will be an all-seating show with the exception of bar and overflow areas only."

GP is $22. 18+\n\nNoname (born Fatimah Warner) is an American artist from Chicago, Illinois, who blurs the lines of poetry and rap through the music she creates. Noname grew up in Bronzeville, a historic neighborhood on the southside of Chicago that famously attracted accomplished black artists and intellectuals of all types. Noname first discovered her love for words while taking a creative writing class as a sophmore in highschool. On July 31st Noname released her debut project entitled Telefone which was 3 years in the making and highly anticipated by fans and media alike. Instantly the project gained critical acclaim with a rave review by Pitchfork and landing her praise from major outlets like Rolling Stones, Complex and Dazed & Confused. Noname has been hailed by The FADER, Complex, and Rolling Stone as one of the most exciting and important new artists of 2016. Thanks to Telefone\u2019s success, Noname played some shows in support of Ms. Lauryn Hill, who hand-picked Noname to open for her on tour. When first approaching the project, Noname set out to emulate the feeling of talking on the phone with someone for the first time. She describes Telefone as \u201can introductory conversation with someone you\u2019re interested in\u201d. But as Noname continued to work on the tape, it also transitioned a bit into mortality: the idea of life and death and the duality between those two things.",

    "notes": "Since 2008 the Bach Parley has been performing primarily on period instruments, that is, harpsichord and baroque style stringed instruments with gut strings. The group focuses on music of Johann Sebastian Bach, his contemporaries, as well as pieces written before J. S. Bach was born with music written in the years 1600-1750.Performing on period-style instruments, the Bach Parley offers unique, exceptional concert experiences to educate and engage our community. We present Baroque music as it was performed hundreds of years ago with a fresh, accessible sound for today\u2019s audiences. The French word \u201cparley\u201d means discussion and a key element of Bach Parley concerts is the commentary provided by Music Director Valerie Arsenault who gives historical context about the composers and offers suggestions about what to listen for in the music.The Tallahassee Bach Parley is also the umbrella organization for a non-profit music school. In 2015, four teachers united to teach violin, viola, and cello at the Bach Parley String Academy at St. John\u2019s Episcopal church, and now the Academy has grown to six teachers, almost 100 students, and even offers ukulele classes.At all Sunday Tallahassee Bach Parley concerts this season, patrons will receive an insert in their programs with a discount coupon to use after the concert at participating downtown area restaurants. A $10 donation is suggested, and free childcare will be offered. The Bach Parley will hold their annual membership reception after the concert.For additional information about the Tallahassee Bach Parley, including the Bach Parley String Academy music school, visit www.bachparley.org.Enjoy the music, the venue, and the magic of Baroque performance with the Tallahassee Bach Parley!"

In 2015, Farruquito was invited to dance with the LA Phil, in four sold-out gala concerts of an adapted version of Amor Brujo directed by Gustavo Dudamel at the Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles. Farruquito returned to the United Stated for a coast-to-coast tour in 2016 and was hailed by The New York Times as the, \u201cgreatest flamenco dancer of his century.\u201dHe has made it his life\u2019s mission to share the purest form of flamenco on stages all around the world while further broadening his influence by collaborating with the most influential artists of our time. From birth his first appearance on stage was on Broadway at 4 years of age with his grandfather in the hit Flamenco Puro. At 11, he was featured in the film Flamenco, which launched his career and positioned him amongst the most elite flamenco artists of the world. He created his first show, Ra\u00edces Flamencas (Flamenco Roots) at 15, which demonstrated his mastery as a dancer and gave him the opportunity to showcase the traditions of his prodigious flamenco line.Previous Event Next Event",

    "notes": "For centuries scientists and engineers have worked within the limitations of the natural world to expand the palette on which musicians can create. This symbiotic relationship is not always widely appreciated, and is symptomatic of much more fundamental connections between science and art that extend into many arenas. Both science and art are driven by intuition and creativity, and both allow genius to express itself in the context of artificial or natural \u201crules\u201d. Understanding the physical nature of music illuminates the beauty of this creative process. Music, science and engineering are connected at many levels. I will use live keyboard demonstrations to illuminate how the origin of some musical styles, particularly blues piano, can be found in fundamental properties of sound and music. In particular, I will focus on the evolution of the scale and its impact on harmony and melody in western music.Murray Gibson became the Dean of the FAMU-FSU College of Engineering in 2016. \u00a0He grew up in the United Kingdom and holds a PhD in Physics from the University of Cambridge.

His guitar playing has been featured on three Grammy\u00ae-nominated albums, including the soundtrack of the Academy-Award winning film The Descendants.Makana\u2019s captivating and wide-ranging performance style has led him to share the stage with Jason Mraz and Jack Johnson, open for music legends Sting, Carlos Santana and Elvis Costello, and perform in venues ranging from Asian and European opera houses to The White House.Born and raised in Hawai\u2019i, Makana grew up on the shores of Waikiki amid the diversity of such legends as Don Ho and Bruno Mars. Makana \u2014 whose name means \u201ca gift given freely\u201d \u2014 began singing when he was 7 years old, took up ukulele at 9 and began learning the ancient art of slack key at 11. By 14, he was performing professionally, and before long, playing five nights a week. His reputation as the youngest virtuoso\u00a0of slack key spread like molten volcanic lava throughout the islands.The focus of Makana\u2019s art is to celebrate the beauty of tradition while exploring new, relevant perceptions, sounds and themes. In his music he often honors his forebearers, the vintage Hawaiian music legends as well as the rock poet idols of the \u201960s, paying homage to the kupuna (elders) who carry within their Beings the cultural wisdom passed down through generations.Previous Event Next Event",

The French word \u201cparley\u201d means discussion and a key element of Bach Parley concerts is the commentary provided by Music Director Valerie Arsenault who gives historical context about the composers and offers suggestions about what to listen for in the music.The Tallahassee Bach Parley is also the umbrella organization for a non-profit music school. In 2015, four teachers united to teach violin, viola, and cello at the Bach Parley String Academy at St. John\u2019s Episcopal church, and now the Academy has grown to six teachers, almost 100 students, and even offers ukulele classes.At all Sunday Tallahassee Bach Parley concerts this season, patrons will receive an insert in their programs with a discount coupon to use after the concert at participating downtown area restaurants. A $10 donation is suggested, and free childcare will be offered. The Bach Parley will hold their annual membership reception after the concert.For additional information about the Tallahassee Bach Parley, including the Bach Parley String Academy music school, visit www.bachparley.org.Enjoy the music, the venue, and the magic of Baroque performance with the Tallahassee Bach Parley!Don\u2019t miss our annual membership reception after the concert\u2026"
