    "notes": "The Mountain Dew Clogging organization is a family oriented group comprised of people of all ages from all of the counties surrounding Tallahassee.Clogging gives you the opportunity to get out and enjoy a great social activity and get fit at the same time. Your legs will tone up very quickly. Clogging improves flexibility, coordination, endurance and strength. It increases lung capacity, relieves stress, and it\u2019s aerobic and burns fat. Clogging is usually danced in lines because there is a better social group feeling when you can see that your new friends are dancing the same routines as you. Some couple and partner routines are taught to keep in touch with the historic Appalachian clogging styles.The instructors teach both the steps and the routines. During classes the instructors cue or call all routines every time they are danced during the learning phase. This means once you know the steps at a given level, you can quickly join in with routines you have never seen.You will find you dance many and varied routines to pretty much all types of music, although country and top 100 current tunes are the most popular.Taps are a double jingle tap ordered from one of our suppliers. The sound of all the taps beating to the music, gets everybody tapping to the rhythms. In clogging the heel tap is used to give a strong regular beat during most steps.Like other worthwhile sporting activities, to progress quickly you may need to practice more than once a week at class. The good news is you can practice anywhere.",

As their forbidden love blossoms, Aida is forced to weigh her heart against the responsibility that she faces as the leader of her people.

Walker wrote this piece for and in the memory of his grandmother.\u00a0 The last piece on this program will be Howard Hanson\u2019s Symphony No. 2 \u201cRomantic\u201d.\u00a0 This piece is most famous for its interlochen theme, and John Williams used music from this Symphony for the movie score E.T.\u00a0 Hanson was considered a Neo-Romantic composer and this piece reflects on 19th Century Romantic Era.

The band plays in the Sacred Steel tradition that arose out of the musical stylings of the House of God Church. The band plays a mixture of funk music and gospel lyrics, staying true to their roots as a religious group. The band is similar in style to other House of God bands, such as Robert Randolph & the Family Band.The band has played many notable shows and festivals, such as the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival, Wakarusa Music and Camping Festival, Langerado, Chicago Blues Festival and Bonnaroo. After their 2006 performance at the event, the Chicago-Sun Times compared the band to Jimi Hendrix, saying:\u201cThe Lee Boys, whose Church of God-inspired sacred steel music may be what Jimi Hendrix had in mind with his grand plan for \u2019electric sky church music.\u2019 Part Robert Randolph, part Holmes Brothers, the Miami quintet sang the praises while whipping the crowd into a frenzy with hypnotic grooves, innovative pedal-steel/lead guitar interplay and funky rhythms.\u201d"

    "notes": "The Tallahassee Bach Parley performs music of the Baroque era (approx. 1600-1750) using period instruments. This recreates for our audiences the experience of hearing and seeing Baroque music as it may have been originally performed hundreds of years ago while generating a fresh sound immediately accessible to listeners today. The Bach Parley is made up of experienced musicians who are trained in historically informed performance, mainly local professional performers and teachers, and FSU faculty and students. Many Bach Parley musicians also perform in Baroque music groups around the country, such as in Atlanta, New York, Texas, and Boston.The word \u201cparley\u201d in French means discussion and a key element of Tallahassee Bach Parley concerts is the commentary offered by our music director to engage and enlighten our audience. These dialogues give the audience a historical background about the composers and their world and suggest what to listen for in the music. This entertaining and light-hearted educational commentary connects the audience with what the musicians are playing, lifts barriers between performers and listeners, and creates a relaxed concert atmosphere with an informed and engaged audience.Other programs include \u201cKids Go For B\u2019roque,\u201d a competition and honors concert featuring talented young musicians from the community performing the music of the Baroque period. We also run the Bach Parley String Academy and offer lessons on violin, viola, and cello as well as ukulele classes."

    "notes": "Eric Gales is an American blues-rock guitarist, originally hailed as a child prodigy. As of 2018 Gales has recorded seventeen albums for major record labels and has done session and tribute work. He has also contributed vocals on several records by the Memphis rap groups Prophet Posse and Three 6 Mafia under the name Lil E. Gales picked up the guitar at age four and was playing in blues competitions by the age of 10. Although Gales plays a right-handed guitar \"upside-down\" (with the bass E string on the bottom), he is not naturally left-handed; he was taught by his brother, who is left-handed, and never second-guessed the untraditional technique. This will be an all-seating show with the exception of bar and overflow areas only."

This recreates for our audiences the experience of hearing and seeing Baroque music as it may have been originally performed hundreds of years ago while generating a fresh sound immediately accessible to listeners today. The Bach Parley is made up of experienced musicians who are trained in historically informed performance, mainly local professional performers and teachers, and FSU faculty and students. Many Bach Parley musicians also perform in Baroque music groups around the country, such as in Atlanta, New York, Texas, and Boston.The word \u201cparley\u201d in French means discussion and a key element of Tallahassee Bach Parley concerts is the commentary offered by our music director to engage and enlighten our audience. These dialogues give the audience a historical background about the composers and their world and suggest what to listen for in the music. This entertaining and light-hearted educational commentary connects the audience with what the musicians are playing, lifts barriers between performers and listeners, and creates a relaxed concert atmosphere with an informed and engaged audience.Other programs include \u201cKids Go For B\u2019roque,\u201d a competition and honors concert featuring talented young musicians from the community performing the music of the Baroque period. We also run the Bach Parley String Academy and offer lessons on violin, viola, and cello as well as ukulele classes."

This recreates for our audiences the experience of hearing and seeing Baroque music as it may have been originally performed hundreds of years ago while generating a fresh sound immediately accessible to listeners today. The Bach Parley is made up of experienced musicians who are trained in historically informed performance, mainly local professional performers and teachers, and FSU faculty and students. Many Bach Parley musicians also perform in Baroque music groups around the country, such as in Atlanta, New York, Texas, and Boston.The word \u201cparley\u201d in French means discussion and a key element of Tallahassee Bach Parley concerts is the commentary offered by our music director to engage and enlighten our audience. These dialogues give the audience a historical background about the composers and their world and suggest what to listen for in the music. This entertaining and light-hearted educational commentary connects the audience with what the musicians are playing, lifts barriers between performers and listeners, and creates a relaxed concert atmosphere with an informed and engaged audience.Other programs include \u201cKids Go For B\u2019roque,\u201d a competition and honors concert featuring talented young musicians from the community performing the music of the Baroque period. We also run the Bach Parley String Academy and offer lessons on violin, viola, and cello as well as ukulele classes."

This recreates for our audiences the experience of hearing and seeing Baroque music as it may have been originally performed hundreds of years ago while generating a fresh sound immediately accessible to listeners today. The Bach Parley is made up of experienced musicians who are trained in historically informed performance, mainly local professional performers and teachers, and FSU faculty and students. Many Bach Parley musicians also perform in Baroque music groups around the country, such as in Atlanta, New York, Texas, and Boston.The word \u201cparley\u201d in French means discussion and a key element of Tallahassee Bach Parley concerts is the commentary offered by our music director to engage and enlighten our audience. These dialogues give the audience a historical background about the composers and their world and suggest what to listen for in the music. This entertaining and light-hearted educational commentary connects the audience with what the musicians are playing, lifts barriers between performers and listeners, and creates a relaxed concert atmosphere with an informed and engaged audience.Other programs include \u201cKids Go For B\u2019roque,\u201d a competition and honors concert featuring talented young musicians from the community performing the music of the Baroque period. We also run the Bach Parley String Academy and offer lessons on violin, viola, and cello as well as ukulele classes."
