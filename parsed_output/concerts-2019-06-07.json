He has filled his days with all things Handpan; facilitating workshops and immersions, performing, busking, teaching, building, visiting players and builders, and always seeking the ever elusive perfect sound.

The musical revolves around Bobby, a single man who seems to be unable to commit to a steady relationship, a handful of married couples who happen to be his best friends, and his three \u201cgirlfriends.\u201d Bobby is the thread that connects the vignettes as he examines not only his own relationships, but also the marriages of his well-meaning friends.With popular and familiar songs such as \u201cAnother Hundred People,\u201d \u201cMarry Me a Little,\u201d \u201cThe Ladies Who Lunch,\u201d and \u201cBeing Alive\u201d Company is just as entertaining, relevant, and relatable as it was when it debuted in 1970.The show is directed by Matthew Watson, music direction by Gerry Nielsen and choreographed by Darci Brown.\u00a0\u00a0"

Campers study with FSU faculty in a large mixed choir, a women\u2019s or men\u2019s choir, and a variety of small ensembles designed to provide ensemble experience with personal attention. Campers will take two daily elective classes allowing them to explore something new such as diction, conducting, or choral theory. All students will also take part in a singing extravaganza that concludes the Friday evening concert! A Solo Recital and an elite Chamber Choir are also available to a limited number of campers by audition.Daily Classes focus on sight reading, theory, diction and repertoire. The subjects taught in these classes give students a great head start if they are planning to apply for a collegiate music program. All students also participate in small ensembles.\u00a0Small Ensemble assignments are done by the instructors and are based on various criteria including voice parts, gender, age, number of years at camp, and others."

Your legs will tone up very quickly. Clogging improves flexibility, coordination, endurance and strength. It increases lung capacity, relieves stress, and it\u2019s aerobic and burns fat. Clogging is usually danced in lines because there is a better social group feeling when you can see that your new friends are dancing the same routines as you. Some couple and partner routines are taught to keep in touch with the historic Appalachian clogging styles.The instructors teach both the steps and the routines. During classes the instructors cue or call all routines every time they are danced during the learning phase. This means once you know the steps at a given level, you can quickly join in with routines you have never seen.You will find you dance many and varied routines to pretty much all types of music, although country and top 100 current tunes are the most popular.Taps are a double jingle tap ordered from one of our suppliers. The sound of all the taps beating to the music, gets everybody tapping to the rhythms. In clogging the heel tap is used to give a strong regular beat during most steps.Like other worthwhile sporting activities, to progress quickly you may need to practice more than once a week at class. The good news is you can practice anywhere.",

He reportedly said \u201cDon\u2019t worry. It is here,\u201d pointing to his head. He went to his desk well after midnight and spent the entire evening composing, as his wife helped to keep him awake with punch and poetry readings. There was no time to write a score, so he wrote out the individual parts without one! A copyist had been ordered at 7a.m., and at 7a.m., the overture was finished. The work is virtually the first movement of a symphony and contains no themes from the opera. At the end, the music quietly glides into Leporello\u2019s first aria. For the benefit of concert performances, Mozart provided a louder ending in the correct key of D major.A note on the Haydn Symphony no. 104:Haydn\u2019s Symphony No. 104 in D major, the \u201cLondon,\u201d was the last of twelve symphonies he wrote for English audiences, and while there is no evidence that he intended it to be his last, it is a fitting capstone to the symphonic tradition he helped to build. When he was finally freed from his contract with the princely family of Esterh\u00e1zy at the age of 59, Haydn immediately set out for London at the invitation of German violinist and impresario Johann Peter Salomon. Coming from a relative backwater, near what is still a rural area of the Austrian-Hungarian border, Haydn was aware of the international taste of London audiences and \u201cinterested in surprising the public with something new.\u201d Now with an orchestra twice the size of his old one at Esterh\u00e1za, he made good on his promise with the dynamic tomfoolery of the Symphony no. 94, the \u201cSurprise,\u201d which prompted delighted gasps. The response to the oddity of the Symphony no. 95 in C minor, on the other hand, was decidedly unenthusiastic. The \u201cLondon\u201d Symphony is more monumental, although not without Haydn\u2019s characteristic wit, and it more than earned its acclaim."

His first instrument was a dulcimer his father built. Then came drums at age 13, and guitar at 16. Having a career in music has always been his dream, and he\u2019s been making it a reality for the past few years, touring the country and releasing his debut album earlier this year called \u201cDifferent Faces.\u201dMore about Backstage Pass\nBackstage Pass grew out of the Concerts in the Park series begun in 1986, by Florida First Federal and late community leader, Roger Schadd. From 1986 to 2008, free outdoor concerts were held every summer featuring local bands. In order to keep the series going during the recession, Backstage Pass began welcoming guests through the Backstage Door of the Marina Civic Center in 2009, and the first band was \u201cOn Call\u201d, led by the late Hulon Crayton. Tickets were $5 (and they still are) and the community embraced it from the first downbeat. We are so grateful to continue this wonderful tradition."

His first instrument was a dulcimer his father built. Then came drums at age 13, and guitar at 16. Having a career in music has always been his dream, and he\u2019s been making it a reality for the past few years, touring the country and releasing his debut album earlier this year called \u201cDifferent Faces.\u201dMore about Backstage Pass\nBackstage Pass grew out of the Concerts in the Park series begun in 1986, by Florida First Federal and late community leader, Roger Schadd. From 1986 to 2008, free outdoor concerts were held every summer featuring local bands. In order to keep the series going during the recession, Backstage Pass began welcoming guests through the Backstage Door of the Marina Civic Center in 2009, and the first band was \u201cOn Call\u201d, led by the late Hulon Crayton. Tickets were $5 (and they still are) and the community embraced it from the first downbeat. We are so grateful to continue this wonderful tradition."

Alabama introduced rock style guitars, lights, pyrotechnics and sounds to the country audience that has inspired many of today's brightest country stars including Kenny Chesney, Jason Aldean and Luke Bryan.\u00a0While their music continues to stand the test of time, their numbers and stats are beyond compare. 50 years since starting the band, Alabama has charted 43 #1 singles including 21 #1 singles in a row and have won over 179 CMA Awards, Grammy Awards, and ACM Awards. They are members of the Country Music Hall of Fame and have their own star of the Hollywood Walk of Fame. They are also world-class philanthropists who have raised over 250 Million dollars for charity. Celebrate 50 years of ALABAMA on their 50th Anniversary Tour coming to the Donald L.

The TROCKS, as they are affectionately known, quickly garnered a major critical essay by Arlene Croce in The New Yorker, and combined with reviews in The New York Times and The Village Voice, established the Company as an artistic and popular success.

    "notes": "instrumental, pop\n\nThis original musical ensemble features only ukuleles of various sizes and registers, accompanied by the natural voices of the performers. Best known for playing versions of famous rock songs and film themes, the Orchestra often changes these songs to subvert the expectations of the audience. Often a slow piece will follow a fast piece to maintain variety, and a rock song may be followed by classical music. The concept is that if a \u201clevel field\u201d is maintained by playing only the one kind of instrument, then all kinds of music can be played quite easily without the variety appearing to be chaotic. With a mission to make something fresh and entertaining, modern and old-fashioned, audiences like the result. They have played for members of the British Royal Family, Houses of Parliament in London and have \u201cSold Right Out\u201d twice at Carnegie Hall in New York, twice at The Royal Albert Hall in London, and also at Sydney Opera House in Australia.Previous Event Next Event",

These two best friends who met in high school music class have since released five albums and toured extensively across North America. Darlings of the Canadian music scene, Dala is bringing a fresh brand of acoustic pop music to the world. Drawing upon influences like The Beatles, Joni Mitchell, Neil Young and Bob Dylan, Dala writes songs that are both catchy and insightful. Amanda\u2019s ethereal soprano voice blends seamlessly with Sheila\u2019s velvety alto, creating the lush harmonies that have become their trademark. The sheer joy with which they perform is infectious, turning first-time listeners into instant fans. Dala is equally entertaining between songs, telling funny and down to earth stories that make every show unique. \u201cWe go to some emotional places in our music,\u201d Walther says, \u201cHumour serves as a relief from that, and a way to give the audience permission to laugh.\u201d \u201cThe more spontaneous the dialogue between songs,\u201d Carabine adds, \u201cthe better the performance and the more memorable the evening.\u201dPrevious Event ",
