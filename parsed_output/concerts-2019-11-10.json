    "notes": "The musical begins as the bells of Notre Dame sound through the famed cathedral in fifteenth-century Paris. Quasimodo, the deformed bell-ringer who longs to be \u201cOut There,\u201d observes all of Paris reveling in the Feast of Fools. Held captive by his devious caretaker, the archdeacon Dom Claude Frollo, he escapes for the day and joins the boisterous crowd, only to be treated cruelly by all but the beautiful gypsy, Esmeralda. Quasimodo isn\u2019t the only one captivated by her free spirit, though \u2013 the handsome Captain Phoebus and Frollo are equally enthralled. As the three vie for her attention, Frollo embarks on a mission to destroy the gypsies \u2013 and it\u2019s up to Quasimodo to save them all.Sponsored by Tallahassee Segway Tours"

Using a combination of magic and common sense, Mary teaches the family members how to value each other again. She takes the children on many memorable adventures, but Jane and Michael aren\u2019t the only ones upon whom\u00a0she has a profound effect. Even grown-ups can learn a lesson or two from the nanny who advises that \u201cAnything can happen if you let it.\u201d Mary Poppins\u00a0is an enchanting mixture of irresistible story, unforgettable songs and breath taking dance numbers."

    "notes": "The Bach Parley concert on Sunday, Nov. 10, 2019, will begin with music from North Germany and conclude with a Mass for Christmas Eve in France.The first piece on the concert is by Dieterich Buxtehude, Jesu meines Lebens Leben (Jesus, my life\u2019s life). The entire text is set over four descending bass line notes which repeat many times. \u201cWhen composers write over this four-note pattern the result is always hypnotic and passionate. This piece has been stuck in my head since I first heard it last June,\u201d says Music Director Valerie Arsenault, \u201cand we are happy to share this earworm.\u201d When Johann Sebastian was 20 years old he walked 250 miles from Arnstadt to L\u00fcbeck to learn about musical style from Buxtehude.For traveling music from Germany to France, the period-instrument ensemble will play parts of a beloved Sonata by Georg Muffat, including a heartwarming G major Passacaglia, a form which also uses a repeating bass line. Arsenault says, \u201cI love to play this piece because it\u2019s like a big musical hug that offers comfort and encouragement \u2014 and we can all use some of that sometimes!\u201dFor the finale, the Bach Parley Chamber Singers will rejoin with the players for Marc-Antoine Charpentier\u2019s Messe de Minuet pour No\u00ebl (Midnight Mass). The Latin words of the Mass are set to catchy and endearing French No\u00ebls. Arsenault says, \u201cWe sing and dance our way through these lovely tunes, and we hope the concert will refresh and lighten everyone\u2019s spirits.\u201dThe performers are violinists Valerie Arsenault and Minyoung Cho, violists Melissa Brewer and Gesa Kordes, cellist Kim Jones, bassist Christian Marshall, harpsichordist Charles Brewer, and Karen Large and Sarah Jane Young on traverso flutes.This is music director Valerie Arsenault\u2019s 12th year leading the Bach Parley. The Bach Parley performs on period instruments \u2013 harpsichord and baroque style stringed instruments with gut strings, and on this concert, the flute is called a traverso, which is an early wooden version of the flute without keys to press down. The French word \u201cparley\u201d means discussion, and a key element of Bach Parley concerts is the commentary provided by Arsenault who gives historical context about the composers and the instruments and offers suggestions about what to listen for in the music.Arsenault says, \u201cWe are especially excited to welcome back our beautiful harpsichord after it spent a week at \u201cthe spa\u201d having maintenance work done and getting all new strings for the first time since it was built in 1986. Our harpsichord has always sounded beautiful, and now even more so!\u201dThe Tallahassee Bach Parley is also the umbrella organization for a non-profit music school, The Bach Parley String Academy, now in its fifth year offering violin, viola, and cello lessons at St. John\u2019s Episcopal Church.The concert will be at 3PM on Sunday, November 10 at St. John\u2019s Episcopal Church, 211 North Monroe Street in Tallahassee. At all Sunday Tallahassee Bach Parley concerts this season, patrons will receive an insert in their programs with a discount coupon to use after the concert at participating downtown area restaurants. A $10 donation is suggested, and free childcare will be available.For additional information about the Tallahassee Bach Parley, including the Bach Parley String Academy music school, visit www.bachparley.org.Enjoy the music, the venue, and the magic of Baroque instruments with the Tallahassee Bach Parley."

Email all questions to info@fifthandthomas.com or to book your reservations.\u00a0\u00a0With The Hurting Kind,\u00a0John Paul White\u00a0has crafted a stunning album that draws on the lush, orchestrated music made in Nashville in the early 1960s. Yet these songs retain a modern feel, whether he\u2019s writing about overwhelming love, unraveling relationships, or the fading memory of a loved one.\u00a0White grew up in tiny Loretto, Tennessee, and now lives in Florence, Alabama, not far from Muscle Shoals. He has cultivated his career in Nashville for two decades, first as a songwriter for a major publisher, then as half of\u00a0The Civil Wars\u00a0\u2013 a groundbreaking duo that won four Grammy Awards before disbanding in 2012.\u00a0Because The Civil Wars were so hard to categorize, White has earned a fan base among indie rock listeners, folk audiences, Americana outlets, and AAA radio. So, what will happen if people hear The Hurting Kind and call it country? \u201cWell, that doesn\u2019t scare me in the least,\u201d he says. \u201cAs a matter of fact, it kind of thrills me.\u201d\u00a0Learn More About the Artist:JOHN PAUL WHITE: Official Website | Facebook | Youtube | Instagram | Twitter",

    "notes": "The Mountain Dew Clogging organization is a family oriented group comprised of people of all ages from all of the counties surrounding Tallahassee.Clogging gives you the opportunity to get out and enjoy a great social activity and get fit at the same time. Your legs will tone up very quickly. Clogging improves flexibility, coordination, endurance and strength. It increases lung capacity, relieves stress, and it\u2019s aerobic and burns fat. Clogging is usually danced in lines because there is a better social group feeling when you can see that your new friends are dancing the same routines as you. Some couple and partner routines are taught to keep in touch with the historic Appalachian clogging styles.The instructors teach both the steps and the routines. During classes the instructors cue or call all routines every time they are danced during the learning phase. This means once you know the steps at a given level, you can quickly join in with routines you have never seen.You will find you dance many and varied routines to pretty much all types of music, although country and top 100 current tunes are the most popular.Taps are a double jingle tap ordered from one of our suppliers. The sound of all the taps beating to the music, gets everybody tapping to the rhythms. In clogging the heel tap is used to give a strong regular beat during most steps.Like other worthwhile sporting activities, to progress quickly you may need to practice more than once a week at class. The good news is you can practice anywhere.",

The band does not exactly aim for faithful recreations of such hits as \u201cBiggest Part of Me\u201d by Ambrosia or \u201cBaby Come Back\u201d by Player. The Naugahyde\u2019s musical world view exists somewhere between deconstructed nostalgia and elevator music."

    "notes": "This performance is funded in part by a grant from South Arts in partnership with the National Endowment for the Arts and the Georgia Council for the Arts.David Evans is a noted blues scholar and musician who has been instrumental in documenting some of the remaining vestiges of traditional blues in Memphis and the surrounding region. Author of Big Road Blues, Evans heads the doctorate program in Ethnomusicology at the University of Memphis.Born in Boston, Evans came to the blues through the folk revival of the mid-\u201960s and after seeing such legendary performers as Son House, Mississippi John Hurt, and Sleepy John Estes, he decided to pursue the study of the blues tradition as a career. In 1966, while in graduate school at UCLA, he began making field trips to the south to research and record blues musicians.In 1970, Evans recorded Bentonia bluesman Jack Owens. The record, It Must Have Been the Devil, was reissued in 1995. He produced Jessie Mae Hemphill\u2019s She Wolf (1981) and Feelin\u2019 Good (1987), playing rhythm guitar accompaniment on both records.In 1994, he recorded a number of regional artists on an excellent record, The Spirit Lives On, Deep South Country Blues and Spirituals in the 1990s. In 1997, Evans\u2019 group The Last Chance Jug Band, an ensemble modeled on the jug bands of Memphis during the 1920s and \u201930s, released its debut album, Shake That Thing."

Produced by Grammy nominee\nSam Ashworth and recorded at Brown Owl Studios in Nashville this album has\neverything from traditional country to folk rock steeped in harmony and an earthy\ninstrumentation.THE CURRYS, who cut their teeth playing the oyster bars and listening rooms of\nthe Florida Panhandle, have since written and released three full-length albums:\nFollow (2014), is \u201cone of the most beautiful pieces of music I\u2019ve ever heard\u201d (Todd\nMoe of NCPR); West of Here (2016), with its \u201ctight-as-a-rubber-band\u201d harmonies\n(PopMatters); and This Side of the Glass (2019), which maps new terrain, but like\nthe previous albums, provides the band\u2019s three-part family harmonies and the\norganic, lived-in feel of roots music."

    "notes": "ballet, comedy, dance\n\nLes Ballets Trockadero de Monte Carlo was founded in 1974 by a group of ballet enthusiasts for the purpose of presenting a playful, entertaining view of traditional, classical ballet in parody form and en travesty. Les Ballets Trockadero first performed in the late-late shows in Off-Off Broadway lofts. The TROCKS, as they are affectionately known, quickly garnered a major critical essay by Arlene Croce in The New Yorker, and combined with reviews in The New York Times and The Village Voice, established the Company as an artistic and popular success. By mid 1975, the TROCKS\u2019 inspired blend of their loving knowledge of dance, their comic approach, and the astounding fact that men can, indeed, dance en pointe without falling flat on their faces, was being noted beyond New York. Articles and notices in publications such as Variety, Oui, The London Daily Telegraph, as well as a Richard Avedon photo essay in Vogue, have made the company nationally and internationally known.Previous Event Next Event",

    "notes": "The Tallahassee Bach Parley performs music of the Baroque era (approx. 1600-1750) using period instruments. This recreates for our audiences the experience of hearing and seeing Baroque music as it may have been originally performed hundreds of years ago while generating a fresh sound immediately accessible to listeners today. The Bach Parley is made up of experienced musicians who are trained in historically informed performance, mainly local professional performers and teachers, and FSU faculty and students. Many Bach Parley musicians also perform in Baroque music groups around the country, such as in Atlanta, New York, Texas, and Boston.The word \u201cparley\u201d in French means discussion and a key element of Tallahassee Bach Parley concerts is the commentary offered by our music director to engage and enlighten our audience. These dialogues give the audience a historical background about the composers and their world and suggest what to listen for in the music. This entertaining and light-hearted educational commentary connects the audience with what the musicians are playing, lifts barriers between performers and listeners, and creates a relaxed concert atmosphere with an informed and engaged audience.Other programs include \u201cKids Go For B\u2019roque,\u201d a competition and honors concert featuring talented young musicians from the community performing the music of the Baroque period. We also run the Bach Parley String Academy and offer lessons on violin, viola, and cello as well as ukulele classes."

Stubblefield (keyboardist Rick Steff joined in 2006) started playing shows in Memphis. The band\u2019s first show was April 13, 1998 at a warehouse space across the street from what is now the National Civil Rights Museum, the infamous Lorraine Motel where Martin Luther King Jr. was shot. Their first set was six songs played to about six people. On August 3, 2018, record release day for Among the Ghosts, the band will be co-headlining Red Rocks Amphitheater in Colorado.The band\u2019s ninth studio album, Among the Ghosts, is their first for noted Nashville indie label Thirty Tigers. It was recorded and co-produced with Grammy-winning engineer/producer and Memphis native Matt Ross-Spang (Jason Isbell, Margo Price, Drive by Truckers) at the historic Sam Phillips Recording Service, the studio built by the legendary producer after outgrowing his Memphis Recording Service/Sun Studio.Recorded primarily live as a five-piece, Among the Ghosts eschews the Stax-inspired horns and Jerry Lee Lewis-style boogie piano featured on some of the band\u2019s past recordings for a streamlined rock & roll sound that pays homage to their seminal influences as it seeks to push that legacy into the future. For a band who carried the torch of the alt-country movement back in the 90\u2019s and helped pave the way for what is now called Americana, Lucero have re-discovered what inspired them in the first place. The sound is more their own and at the same time not exactly like anything they\u2019ve done before. This is a band settling into their craft. The 10-song disc\u2019s title is both a tribute to the spirits which roam the streets of their fabled city, as well as the hard road the determinedly independent band set out on 20 years ago. The band played around 200 shows per year for many of those 20 years.\u201cIt may have taken 20 years, but everything has fallen in place right where it needs to be,\u201d acknowledges Nichols. \u201cThere were some dark days in those middle years, but we\u2019ve learned how to do this and survive. We still write heartbreak songs, but now, with a family at home, it\u2019s a whole new kind of heartbreak.\u201d Among the Ghosts lays out that new territory with alacrity, as Lucero shines their Morning Star, burning just as brightly, if not more so, 20 years later. As one of the album\u2019s song titles so aptly puts it, \u201cEverything Has Changed\u201d, but one thing hasn\u2019t\u2026 Lucero\u2019s music remains more vital than ever.\u00a0Learn More About the Artists:LUCERO:\nOfficial Website\u00a0|\u00a0Facebook\u00a0|\u00a0Twitter\u00a0|\u00a0Instagram\u00a0|\u00a0Youtube",

This recreates for our audiences the experience of hearing and seeing Baroque music as it may have been originally performed hundreds of years ago while generating a fresh sound immediately accessible to listeners today. The Bach Parley is made up of experienced musicians who are trained in historically informed performance, mainly local professional performers and teachers, and FSU faculty and students. Many Bach Parley musicians also perform in Baroque music groups around the country, such as in Atlanta, New York, Texas, and Boston.The word \u201cparley\u201d in French means discussion and a key element of Tallahassee Bach Parley concerts is the commentary offered by our music director to engage and enlighten our audience. These dialogues give the audience a historical background about the composers and their world and suggest what to listen for in the music. This entertaining and light-hearted educational commentary connects the audience with what the musicians are playing, lifts barriers between performers and listeners, and creates a relaxed concert atmosphere with an informed and engaged audience.Other programs include \u201cKids Go For B\u2019roque,\u201d a competition and honors concert featuring talented young musicians from the community performing the music of the Baroque period. We also run the Bach Parley String Academy and offer lessons on violin, viola, and cello as well as ukulele classes."

It is a classic American tale of rags to riches. From humble beginnings picking cotton in the fields to international stars that went on to sell 80 million albums while changing the face and sound of country music.\u00a0Quality songs that have become the soundtrack for American life are the foundation for ALABAMA\u2019s stellar career. Alabama introduced rock style guitars, lights, pyrotechnics and sounds to the country audience that has inspired many of today's brightest country stars including Kenny Chesney, Jason Aldean and Luke Bryan.\u00a0While their music continues to stand the test of time, their numbers and stats are beyond compare. 50 years since starting the band, Alabama has charted 43 #1 singles including 21 #1 singles in a row and have won over 179 CMA Awards, Grammy Awards, and ACM Awards. They are members of the Country Music Hall of Fame and have their own star of the Hollywood Walk of Fame. They are also world-class philanthropists who have raised over 250 Million dollars for charity. Celebrate 50 years of ALABAMA on their 50th Anniversary Tour coming to the Donald L. Tucker Civic Center\u00a0on October 10th."
