    "notes": "The Mountain Dew Clogging organization is a family oriented group comprised of people of all ages from all of the counties surrounding Tallahassee.Clogging gives you the opportunity to get out and enjoy a great social activity and get fit at the same time. Your legs will tone up very quickly. Clogging improves flexibility, coordination, endurance and strength. It increases lung capacity, relieves stress, and it\u2019s aerobic and burns fat. Clogging is usually danced in lines because there is a better social group feeling when you can see that your new friends are dancing the same routines as you. Some couple and partner routines are taught to keep in touch with the historic Appalachian clogging styles.The instructors teach both the steps and the routines. During classes the instructors cue or call all routines every time they are danced during the learning phase. This means once you know the steps at a given level, you can quickly join in with routines you have never seen.You will find you dance many and varied routines to pretty much all types of music, although country and top 100 current tunes are the most popular.Taps are a double jingle tap ordered from one of our suppliers. The sound of all the taps beating to the music, gets everybody tapping to the rhythms. In clogging the heel tap is used to give a strong regular beat during most steps.Like other worthwhile sporting activities, to progress quickly you may need to practice more than once a week at class. The good news is you can practice anywhere.",

Her voice is both lilting and lucid, and when she says that she wants to create music that is truly original and unmistakably hers, her quietness shifts into a steely audacity that\u2019s charming and almost funny\u2013\u2013she\u2019s only 25, after all. But then, you remember her songs and her playing. And it hits you: brash, beautiful originality is exactly what Molly is doing.The 2017 release of her debut EP Rise further introduced Molly to a roots music audience who had already enthusiastically embraced and elevated her. Her 2017 and 2018 wins for Guitar Player of the Year from the International Bluegrass Association (IBMA) were history-making, as the first woman to be nominated for the honor, and the accolades have kept coming in 2018 with Folk Alliance International\u00a0awarding her\u00a0\u201c\u00a0Song of the Year\u201d for\u00a0\u201cYou Didn\u2019t Call My Name\u201d during the\u00a0International Folk Music Awards. She was also\u00a0named Instrumentalist of the Year by the Americana Music Association.Last year Tuttle performed for enthusiastic audiences on such prestigious stages as as Celtic Connections, Mariposa Folk Festival, Hardly Strictly Bluegrass Festival, Americana Music Festival, Philadelphia Folk Festival and many more as well as dozens of sold-out headline performances.With all of this recognition, it might be easy to forget that Tuttle has yet to release a full-length album. In between tours, she has been hard at work in the studio crafting her eagerly-anticipated debut album with producer/engineer Ryan Hewitt (Avett Brothers, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Lumineers), which will be released in early 2019 on Compass Records.Previous Event Next Event",

As a fifth generation musician who grew up surrounded by walls of instruments and family members to teach him how to play them, it would seem to be a givenn that Will Thompson would play music for the rest of his life. And while that has proven to be the case, every path has it\u2019s unexpected turns.At 18 years old, Will sold everything he owned and took out a loan to buy recording equipment to fully realize the music he had been writing on his guitar. Locking himself away for months at a time he honed his skills as a producer, songwriter, singer. By the time Will got everything he wanted in the form of a record contract from his all time musical idol, he walked away from it all feeling like he wasn\u2019t making the music he wanted to.After being haunted by the love he tried to leave behind, he knew it was time to return to his lifelong family calling in writing and recording songs. In 2015, Will Thompson recorded and released his new album \u2018Turn it Up\u2019, a mix of rock country anthems that showcases stadium-ready songwriting and soulful production at every turn. As for Will there\u2019s no looking back as he prepares to play shows and write for himself and other artists. He carries his family tradition forward and puts what\u2019s in his blood into every song.Learn More About the Artist:WILL THOMPSON:\u00a0Official Website\u00a0|\u00a0Facebook\u00a0|\u00a0Youtube",

No refunds or exchanges of ticket purchases. Advance tickets will also be on sale electronically via Eventbrite and in person with NO FEES at\u00a0Finnegan\u2019s Wake\u00a0Irish Pub.This incredible trio was created by Detroit native and internationally acclaimed percussionist Gerald Cleaver, in collaboration with Larry Ochs, founder of the legendary Rova Saxophone Quartet. With the addition in 2015 of experimental guitar icon Nels Cline (who belatedly became a pop-guitar icon by joining Wilco) the trio\u2019s lineup was complete.NELS CLINE might be as close as the modern avant-garde gets to a household name. Before joining indie rock institution Wilco in 2004, Cline divided his energy between improvised contexts alongside Julius Hemphill, Vinny Golia, and brother Alex, and more song-oriented settings like Carla Bozulich\u2019s alt-country outfit Geraldine Fibbers and Mike Watt\u2019s Crew of the Flying Saucer. Cline continues to occupy the narrow space between pure sound and song, as exemplified by his longstanding Singers trio with drummer Scott Amendola and bassist Trevor Dunn, and his recent duo with guitar prodigy Julian Lage.\u00a0www.nelscline.comIn his own words, Detroit-bred, New York-based GERALD CLEAVER\u2019s multifaceted approach to the drum set balances \u201cstatic sound and extreme dynamics, melodicism within heavy texture, deep-rooted groove, unchained abandon, and the power and revelation of recurring form.\u201d Cleaver made a name for himself through enduring partnerships with Vision Fest regulars like Roscoe Mitchell and Charles Gayle, but lately critics have been abuzz about his new musique concr\u00e8te-cum-free rock quintet Black Host with Darius Jones, Cooper-Moore, Brandon Seabrook, and Pascal Niggenkemper. Pitchfork\u2019s Hank Shteamer described 2013\u2019s Life in the Sugar Candle Mines as, \u201ca well-tended hot-house: feverish and bracingly weird, yet also purposeful and shrewdly strategic.\u201dLARRY OCHS is best known as a founder of the Rova Sax Quartet, a San Francisco institution that pioneered the application of improvisational strategies within the context of contemporary composition, beginning in the late 1970s and continuing right up to the present day: 40 years old in 2018. Equally inspired by modernist 20th century composition and the more worldly, abrasive strands of 60s free jazz, Rova and Ochs became widely celebrated for the lengths they would go to stretch the performance parameters of notated music through early collaborations with Henry Kaiser, Fred Frith, and John Zorn. Ochs connection with Cline began in the late 1990\u2019s and culminated with the Celestial Septet, a septet comprised of both the Rova Sax Quartet and the Nels Cline Singers, with a fantastic CD release including a long, ecstatic Ochs composition and tours from 2009 \u2013 2011. Ochs and Cleaver have performed off and on as a duo since 2013; a duo CD release (coming in 2018) \u2013 a beautiful , haunting set of music called \u201cSongs of the Wild Cave\u201d \u2013 will document their 2016 live recording made inside a secret cave in the Dordogne area of France; a cave that contains upwards of 150 Pleistocene-era paintings. It\u2019s a unique recording in which the cave itself seriously influenced the music, becoming essentially the third member of a trio.\u00a0www.ochs.ccLearn More About the Artist:NELS CLINE \u2013 GERALD CLEAVER \u2013 LARRY OCHS:\u00a0Official Website",

    "notes": "Doors: 7pm | Music: 8pm\nNo Cover | Ages 21+ Only\u00a0Celebrating their 33rd Anniversary together, Atlanta-based folk rock act, Drivin N Cryin, have spent most of their career on tour. In October 1985 Drivin N Cryin played their first show at Atlanta\u2019s famed 688 Club. The band quickly gained attention for their blistering live shows, and amassed a rabid fanbase in the fertile soil of the late-1980s Southeast music scene. Now, 33 years later, and after releasing four full length albums on Island Records and one on Geffen Records, founding members Kevn Kinney and Tim Nielsen find themselves enjoying a milestone anniversary for the band, having survived the pressures of fame, a shifting musical landscape, multiple lineup changes, and miles of back roads and highways to arrive here. With a gold record, 10 full-length albums, and a handful of EPs to their credit, the band still refuses to rest. In 2012, a documentary about the band, entitled Scarred but Smarter: Life n Times of Drivin\u2019 N\u2019 Cryin\u2019, was produced. In 2015, a collection of 10 choice cuts from the band\u2019s 4-EP \u201cSongs\u201d series, entitled Best of Songs, was released on Nashville\u2019s Plowboy Records. Additionally, the band was inducted into the Georgia Music Hall of Fame that same year. The following year, Drivin N Cryin released a vinyl-only album, entitled Archives Vol One, with a collection of basement recordings from the years 1988 to 1990. With Dave V. Johnson as their drummer, and the band\u2019s newest member, Laur Joamets, (originally Sturgill Simpson) now being added to the lineup, Drivin N Cryin continues to tour the U.S. to great acclaim.More about the band:\nWebsite\u00a0|\u00a0YouTube\u00a0|\u00a0Facebook\u00a0|\u00a0Instagram\u00a0|\u00a0Twitter\u00a0|\u00a0Spotify\u00a0Whiskey in the Pines\u2019 unmistakably Southern moniker\u2014a perfect fit for its brand of heartfelt, no-frills Americana\u2014was inspired by their frequent excursions down US-319 south to the languid shores of the Gulf. The band\u2019s Florida roots imbue their alt-country songs with a gentle warmth and sense of connectedness. This is heartland rock & roll, shot through with ambling, country-tinged flourishes. There are songs that would perfectly score a backyard day-drinking session, and others that work as peaceful codas to soundtrack the after-party cleanup.\u00a0As seen on stage with: Lucero, John Moreland, American Aquarium, Plane White T\u2019s, Sister Hazel, Roadkill Ghost Choir, Shane Smith and the Saints, Jason Eady.More about the band:\nWebsite\u00a0|\u00a0Facebook\u00a0|\u00a0Instagram\u00a0|\u00a0Spotify",

In the wake of the latest tsunami of survivor stories, Cash has embraced women\u2019s narratives in this powerful material.\u00a0 \u201cThere is a woman\u2019s real life, complex experiences and layered understanding in these songs,\u201d Rosanne says. \u201cI could not have written them 10 years ago\u2014not even close.

Bach was born with music written in the years 1600-1750.Performing on period-style instruments, the Bach Parley offers unique, exceptional concert experiences to educate and engage our community. We present Baroque music as it was performed hundreds of years ago with a fresh, accessible sound for today\u2019s audiences. The French word \u201cparley\u201d means discussion and a key element of Bach Parley concerts is the commentary provided by Music Director Valerie Arsenault who gives historical context about the composers and offers suggestions about what to listen for in the music.The Tallahassee Bach Parley is also the umbrella organization for a non-profit music school. In 2015, four teachers united to teach violin, viola, and cello at the Bach Parley String Academy at St. John\u2019s Episcopal church, and now the Academy has grown to six teachers, almost 100 students, and even offers ukulele classes.At all Sunday Tallahassee Bach Parley concerts this season, patrons will receive an insert in their programs with a discount coupon to use after the concert at participating downtown area restaurants. A $10 donation is suggested, and free childcare will be offered. The Bach Parley will hold their annual membership reception after the concert.For additional information about the Tallahassee Bach Parley, including the Bach Parley String Academy music school, visit www.bachparley.org.Enjoy the music, the venue, and the magic of Baroque performance with the Tallahassee Bach Parley!Don\u2019t miss our annual membership reception after the concert\u2026"

    "notes": "It's been 50 years since Randy, Jeff and Teddy, left the cotton farms of Fort Payne, Alabama, to spend the summer playing music in a Myrtle Beach, South Carolina bar called The Bowery. It is a classic American tale of rags to riches. From humble beginnings picking cotton in the fields to international stars that went on to sell 80 million albums while changing the face and sound of country music.\u00a0Quality songs that have become the soundtrack for American life are the foundation for ALABAMA\u2019s stellar career. Alabama introduced rock style guitars, lights, pyrotechnics and sounds to the country audience that has inspired many of today's brightest country stars including Kenny Chesney, Jason Aldean and Luke Bryan.\u00a0While their music continues to stand the test of time, their numbers and stats are beyond compare. 50 years since starting the band, Alabama has charted 43 #1 singles including 21 #1 singles in a row and have won over 179 CMA Awards, Grammy Awards, and ACM Awards. They are members of the Country Music Hall of Fame and have their own star of the Hollywood Walk of Fame. They are also world-class philanthropists who have raised over 250 Million dollars for charity. Celebrate 50 years of ALABAMA on their 50th Anniversary Tour coming to the Donald L. Tucker Civic Center\u00a0on October 10th."
