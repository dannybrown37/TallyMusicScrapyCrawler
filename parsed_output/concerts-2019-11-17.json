Quasimodo, the deformed bell-ringer who longs to be \u201cOut There,\u201d observes all of Paris reveling in the Feast of Fools. Held captive by his devious caretaker, the archdeacon Dom Claude Frollo, he escapes for the day and joins the boisterous crowd, only to be treated cruelly by all but the beautiful gypsy, Esmeralda. Quasimodo isn\u2019t the only one captivated by her free spirit, though \u2013 the handsome Captain Phoebus and Frollo are equally enthralled. As the three vie for her attention, Frollo embarks on a mission to destroy the gypsies \u2013 and it\u2019s up to Quasimodo to save them all.Sponsored by Tallahassee Segway Tours"

Your legs will tone up very quickly. Clogging improves flexibility, coordination, endurance and strength. It increases lung capacity, relieves stress, and it\u2019s aerobic and burns fat. Clogging is usually danced in lines because there is a better social group feeling when you can see that your new friends are dancing the same routines as you. Some couple and partner routines are taught to keep in touch with the historic Appalachian clogging styles.The instructors teach both the steps and the routines. During classes the instructors cue or call all routines every time they are danced during the learning phase. This means once you know the steps at a given level, you can quickly join in with routines you have never seen.You will find you dance many and varied routines to pretty much all types of music, although country and top 100 current tunes are the most popular.Taps are a double jingle tap ordered from one of our suppliers. The sound of all the taps beating to the music, gets everybody tapping to the rhythms. In clogging the heel tap is used to give a strong regular beat during most steps.Like other worthwhile sporting activities, to progress quickly you may need to practice more than once a week at class. The good news is you can practice anywhere.",

Author of Big Road Blues, Evans heads the doctorate program in Ethnomusicology at the University of Memphis.Born in Boston, Evans came to the blues through the folk revival of the mid-\u201960s and after seeing such legendary performers as Son House, Mississippi John Hurt, and Sleepy John Estes, he decided to pursue the study of the blues tradition as a career. In 1966, while in graduate school at UCLA, he began making field trips to the south to research and record blues musicians.In 1970, Evans recorded Bentonia bluesman Jack Owens. The record, It Must Have Been the Devil, was reissued in 1995. He produced Jessie Mae Hemphill\u2019s She Wolf (1981) and Feelin\u2019 Good (1987), playing rhythm guitar accompaniment on both records.In 1994, he recorded a number of regional artists on an excellent record, The Spirit Lives On, Deep South Country Blues and Spirituals in the 1990s. In 1997, Evans\u2019 group The Last Chance Jug Band, an ensemble modeled on the jug bands of Memphis during the 1920s and \u201930s, released its debut album, Shake That Thing."

Batay La, a 25-minute documentary, examines the current anti-imperialist movement in Haiti, led for decades by grassroots workers organization Batay Ouvriye (Workers\u2019 Struggle). Founded in 1994, Batay Ouvriye is known throughout Haiti as a fierce, uncompromising organization dedicated to reconstructing Haiti in the interests of workers, peasants, and the poor.\u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s why we organize ourselves\u2013so we can stand up for our rights. We work so that tomorrow we can make the change that we hope for,\u201d says a Haitian peasant organized with Batay Ouvriye. While Haiti might feel far removed to some in the US, extreme inequality, corporate power, and societal division have become the norm for American life as well. Come learn from an independent movement working to shift their country\u2019s reality.\u00a0The screening is followed by a panel discussion with director and FSU assistant professor, Malia Bruker, organizer/producer, Sarah Cruz and a Haitian revolutionary organizer. There will also be an audience Q&A. The event opens and closes with Haitian roots music from Miami-based artist Jan Sebon of Kazaak International.The conversation continues Sunday, November 24th at 3:30pm at The Plant with \u201cResisting Imperialism,\u201d hosted by One Struggle, Miami and sponsored by FSU CPE. In the US, we benefit from the production of cheap goods in other countries, but what are the relations that make this possible? Learn about the current political situation in Haiti, what imperialism is, and why it matters for building an independent social movement in the US. A Haitian organizer will be present, and Jan Sebon performs again!"

With their sophomore release, In The Company Of Wolves, they continue to urge audiences to practice simplicity, patience and positivity. The new EP also represents the group\u2019s maturity and willingness to tackle far-reaching, hefty topics in a 5 song release.While touring the Southeast, the band is constantly evolving the way they impact their community by putting on free shows for fans, participating in benefit concerts, and volunteering with organizations like The Water Project. Chillin for Kids, and V.O.C.A.L. Animal Rescue. The Stealing Secrets EP, released May 2014, has an inspirational theme and was written mostly about evolving one\u2019s thoughts to come to a higher understanding about life, while also focusing on addiction and the struggles that it brings. \u201cWe wanted to give people hope who maybe felt like they had lost it.\u201d With every inspi-reggae song Sway Jah Vu continues to exemplify the message \u2018every day is a second chance.\u2019LEARN MORE ABOUT THE ARTIST:SWAY JAH VU:\u00a0Official Website\u00a0|\u00a0Facebook\u00a0|\u00a0Instagram\u00a0",

Les Ballets Trockadero first performed in the late-late shows in Off-Off Broadway lofts. The TROCKS, as they are affectionately known, quickly garnered a major critical essay by Arlene Croce in The New Yorker, and combined with reviews in The New York Times and The Village Voice, established the Company as an artistic and popular success. By mid 1975, the TROCKS\u2019 inspired blend of their loving knowledge of dance, their comic approach, and the astounding fact that men can, indeed, dance en pointe without falling flat on their faces, was being noted beyond New York. Articles and notices in publications such as Variety, Oui, The London Daily Telegraph, as well as a Richard Avedon photo essay in Vogue, have made the company nationally and internationally known.Previous Event Next Event",

    "notes": "The Tallahassee Bach Parley performs music of the Baroque era (approx. 1600-1750) using period instruments. This recreates for our audiences the experience of hearing and seeing Baroque music as it may have been originally performed hundreds of years ago while generating a fresh sound immediately accessible to listeners today. The Bach Parley is made up of experienced musicians who are trained in historically informed performance, mainly local professional performers and teachers, and FSU faculty and students. Many Bach Parley musicians also perform in Baroque music groups around the country, such as in Atlanta, New York, Texas, and Boston.The word \u201cparley\u201d in French means discussion and a key element of Tallahassee Bach Parley concerts is the commentary offered by our music director to engage and enlighten our audience. These dialogues give the audience a historical background about the composers and their world and suggest what to listen for in the music. This entertaining and light-hearted educational commentary connects the audience with what the musicians are playing, lifts barriers between performers and listeners, and creates a relaxed concert atmosphere with an informed and engaged audience.Other programs include \u201cKids Go For B\u2019roque,\u201d a competition and honors concert featuring talented young musicians from the community performing the music of the Baroque period. We also run the Bach Parley String Academy and offer lessons on violin, viola, and cello as well as ukulele classes."

But these conventional measurements fall short when you\u2019re assessing the impact of The Beach Boys. This band has birthed a torrent of hit singles like \u201cSurfin\u2019,\u201d Good Vibrations\u201d and \u201cCalifornia Girls\u201d and sold albums by the tens of millions. But its greater significance lies in the fact that The Beach Boys changed the musical landscape so profoundly that every pop act since has been in its debt. The Beach Boys continue to create and perform with the same bold imagination and style that marked their explosive debut 40 years ago. Their Capitol Records release, Sounds of Summer, was double platinum with over two million in sales and climbing, marks a resurgence in Beach Boys interest that continues to rock the world.We are pleased to announce that each purchased ticket comes with a digital download of Mike Love\u2019s upcoming album,\u00a012 Sides of Summer.\u00a0You will receive an email from\u00a0officialCOMMUNITY,\u00a0on behalf of The Beach Boys, approximately two weeks after your ticket has been purchased.

Stubblefield (keyboardist Rick Steff joined in 2006) started playing shows in Memphis. The band\u2019s first show was April 13, 1998 at a warehouse space across the street from what is now the National Civil Rights Museum, the infamous Lorraine Motel where Martin Luther King Jr. was shot. Their first set was six songs played to about six people. On August 3, 2018, record release day for Among the Ghosts, the band will be co-headlining Red Rocks Amphitheater in Colorado.The band\u2019s ninth studio album, Among the Ghosts, is their first for noted Nashville indie label Thirty Tigers. It was recorded and co-produced with Grammy-winning engineer/producer and Memphis native Matt Ross-Spang (Jason Isbell, Margo Price, Drive by Truckers) at the historic Sam Phillips Recording Service, the studio built by the legendary producer after outgrowing his Memphis Recording Service/Sun Studio.Recorded primarily live as a five-piece, Among the Ghosts eschews the Stax-inspired horns and Jerry Lee Lewis-style boogie piano featured on some of the band\u2019s past recordings for a streamlined rock & roll sound that pays homage to their seminal influences as it seeks to push that legacy into the future. For a band who carried the torch of the alt-country movement back in the 90\u2019s and helped pave the way for what is now called Americana, Lucero have re-discovered what inspired them in the first place. The sound is more their own and at the same time not exactly like anything they\u2019ve done before. This is a band settling into their craft. The 10-song disc\u2019s title is both a tribute to the spirits which roam the streets of their fabled city, as well as the hard road the determinedly independent band set out on 20 years ago. The band played around 200 shows per year for many of those 20 years.\u201cIt may have taken 20 years, but everything has fallen in place right where it needs to be,\u201d acknowledges Nichols. \u201cThere were some dark days in those middle years, but we\u2019ve learned how to do this and survive. We still write heartbreak songs, but now, with a family at home, it\u2019s a whole new kind of heartbreak.\u201d Among the Ghosts lays out that new territory with alacrity, as Lucero shines their Morning Star, burning just as brightly, if not more so, 20 years later. As one of the album\u2019s song titles so aptly puts it, \u201cEverything Has Changed\u201d, but one thing hasn\u2019t\u2026 Lucero\u2019s music remains more vital than ever.\u00a0Learn More About the Artists:LUCERO:\nOfficial Website\u00a0|\u00a0Facebook\u00a0|\u00a0Twitter\u00a0|\u00a0Instagram\u00a0|\u00a0Youtube",

These two best friends who met in high school music class have since released five albums and toured extensively across North America. Darlings of the Canadian music scene, Dala is bringing a fresh brand of acoustic pop music to the world. Drawing upon influences like The Beatles, Joni Mitchell, Neil Young and Bob Dylan, Dala writes songs that are both catchy and insightful. Amanda\u2019s ethereal soprano voice blends seamlessly with Sheila\u2019s velvety alto, creating the lush harmonies that have become their trademark. The sheer joy with which they perform is infectious, turning first-time listeners into instant fans. Dala is equally entertaining between songs, telling funny and down to earth stories that make every show unique. \u201cWe go to some emotional places in our music,\u201d Walther says, \u201cHumour serves as a relief from that, and a way to give the audience permission to laugh.\u201d \u201cThe more spontaneous the dialogue between songs,\u201d Carabine adds, \u201cthe better the performance and the more memorable the evening.\u201dPrevious Event ",

    "notes": "The Tallahassee Bach Parley performs music of the Baroque era (approx. 1600-1750) using period instruments. This recreates for our audiences the experience of hearing and seeing Baroque music as it may have been originally performed hundreds of years ago while generating a fresh sound immediately accessible to listeners today. The Bach Parley is made up of experienced musicians who are trained in historically informed performance, mainly local professional performers and teachers, and FSU faculty and students. Many Bach Parley musicians also perform in Baroque music groups around the country, such as in Atlanta, New York, Texas, and Boston.The word \u201cparley\u201d in French means discussion and a key element of Tallahassee Bach Parley concerts is the commentary offered by our music director to engage and enlighten our audience. These dialogues give the audience a historical background about the composers and their world and suggest what to listen for in the music. This entertaining and light-hearted educational commentary connects the audience with what the musicians are playing, lifts barriers between performers and listeners, and creates a relaxed concert atmosphere with an informed and engaged audience.Other programs include \u201cKids Go For B\u2019roque,\u201d a competition and honors concert featuring talented young musicians from the community performing the music of the Baroque period. We also run the Bach Parley String Academy and offer lessons on violin, viola, and cello as well as ukulele classes."

It is a classic American tale of rags to riches. From humble beginnings picking cotton in the fields to international stars that went on to sell 80 million albums while changing the face and sound of country music.\u00a0Quality songs that have become the soundtrack for American life are the foundation for ALABAMA\u2019s stellar career. Alabama introduced rock style guitars, lights, pyrotechnics and sounds to the country audience that has inspired many of today's brightest country stars including Kenny Chesney, Jason Aldean and Luke Bryan.\u00a0While their music continues to stand the test of time, their numbers and stats are beyond compare. 50 years since starting the band, Alabama has charted 43 #1 singles including 21 #1 singles in a row and have won over 179 CMA Awards, Grammy Awards, and ACM Awards. They are members of the Country Music Hall of Fame and have their own star of the Hollywood Walk of Fame. They are also world-class philanthropists who have raised over 250 Million dollars for charity. Celebrate 50 years of ALABAMA on their 50th Anniversary Tour coming to the Donald L. Tucker Civic Center\u00a0on October 10th."
