    "notes": "The Mountain Dew Clogging organization is a family oriented group comprised of people of all ages from all of the counties surrounding Tallahassee.Clogging gives you the opportunity to get out and enjoy a great social activity and get fit at the same time. Your legs will tone up very quickly. Clogging improves flexibility, coordination, endurance and strength. It increases lung capacity, relieves stress, and it\u2019s aerobic and burns fat. Clogging is usually danced in lines because there is a better social group feeling when you can see that your new friends are dancing the same routines as you. Some couple and partner routines are taught to keep in touch with the historic Appalachian clogging styles.The instructors teach both the steps and the routines. During classes the instructors cue or call all routines every time they are danced during the learning phase. This means once you know the steps at a given level, you can quickly join in with routines you have never seen.You will find you dance many and varied routines to pretty much all types of music, although country and top 100 current tunes are the most popular.Taps are a double jingle tap ordered from one of our suppliers. The sound of all the taps beating to the music, gets everybody tapping to the rhythms. In clogging the heel tap is used to give a strong regular beat during most steps.Like other worthwhile sporting activities, to progress quickly you may need to practice more than once a week at class. The good news is you can practice anywhere.",

We will follow with a house concert; we\u2019re so proud to welcome back The David Rodock\u00a0Trio and Dirty Bird and the Flu\u2013all these creative friends are from Valdosta!About the Artist:\u00a0Julie Bowland is a Valdosta, Georgia based artist who teaches art and directs the Dedo Maranville Fine Arts Gallery at Valdosta State University. As a landscape painter she applies oil paint in a thick, painterly impasto, painting directly from the wild landscape in bold, expressive color. Sometimes she paints from a canoe or kayak to capture remote, watery places. Formerly a Tallahassee resident, she has a BFA in Painting from Florida State University and an MFA from Arizona State University.Bowland\u2019s work is included in private, public and corporate collections, including the Museum of Arts and Sciences in Daytona Beach; the City of Tallahassee Permanent Collection; Barnett Bank in Jacksonville; First South Bank in Tallahassee and Florida State College at Jacksonville.\u00a0 Her work was featured in a solo exhibition at the Buchanan Museum of Fine Arts in Buchanan, Michigan, and she recently exhibited at the Kobro Gallery, Strzeminski Academy of Fine Arts, Lodz, Poland. Her work is represented by the Venvi Gallery in Tallahassee, Florida.In the recent years, Bowland has led Plein Air\u00a0painting workshops for high school students, college students and adult artists in Florida, Georgia and Utah.Artist Statement, 2019\u201cI work directly from\u00a0nature with oil paint applied in a thick vigorous impasto. Color is everything to me: It expresses intensity of emotion as it defines space and form. While color and form may be freely interpreted, it remains important to me to work from nature.\u00a0 I appreciate the directness and spontaneity of the dynamic, always changing conditions of the outdoors while I paint and draw: They create a joy and a challenge while I work, and I often have no idea how a painting will turn out. That spontaneity is the fun part.The French called painting directly from nature\u00a0en\u00a0plein\u00a0air,\u00a0\u201cin open air.\u201d It is exciting and inspiring to slather paint, engulfed in a wild swamp or forest, to dance with the elements of wind, wildlife, shifting light, and all the other\u00a0uncontrollable aspects of nature.\u00a0This joy and excitement drives me to make art. \u00a0I think of my style of art as\u00a0plein air\u00a0expressionism\u201d.For more information on this fine artist and to see more of her works, please visit her website: http://www.juliebowland.comWe are excited for this opportunity to present our long time friend; her art will join other new works offered by\u00a0gallery owner artists,\u00a0Jenny Odom and Beth Appleton.After the Oct. 5th opening please visit the gallery to see this new exhibition. Her works will be on view and offered for sale during our regular hours: Wednesday-Saturday, 10 am \u2013 5 pm."

Sound designer and music supervisor Glenn Swan has worked for many years in Chicago, Los Angeles, New York and Toronto providing what he calls a \u2018mixtape for the script\u2019 in live theatre settings. Now, for the first time, he brings his ears to the screen with F.W. Murnau\u2019s vampire masterpiece, adapted loosely from Bram Stoker\u2019s Dracula.The terror, humor, obsession, romance, sacrifice and madness all come to the surface with a mind-bending Nosfer-iTunes soundtrack that includes neo-classical, jazz, 70\u2019s TV soundtracks, rock, electronica, avant garde, R&B, metal, pop, exotica and more. Combined with stylish cinematography and Max Schreck\u2019s memorable performance as the vampire, it\u2019s no wonder that \u2013 for close to 100 years \u2013\u00a0Nosferatu has been praised for its influence on not just horror, but moviemaking as a whole.One night only at AllSaints Cinema \u2014 save room for popcorn and other concessions!"

Using a combination of magic and common sense, Mary teaches the family members how to value each other again. She takes the children on many memorable adventures, but Jane and Michael aren\u2019t the only ones upon whom\u00a0she has a profound effect. Even grown-ups can learn a lesson or two from the nanny who advises that \u201cAnything can happen if you let it.\u201d Mary Poppins\u00a0is an enchanting mixture of irresistible story, unforgettable songs and breath taking dance numbers."

Stationed at Joint Base Anacostia-Bolling in Washington, D.C., it is one of six musical ensembles that comprise The U.S. Air Force Band. Created in 1950 to continue the tradition of Major Glenn Miller\u2019s Army Air Forces dance band, the current band consists of 18 active duty Airmen musicians including one vocalist.Through the years, the Airmen of Note has presented its own brand of big band jazz as well as more contemporary forms of jazz to audiences via annual tours across the United States, deployments around the world and local performances throughout metropolitan Washington, D.C. For smaller, more intimate venues, the Airmen of Note Combo and various individual musicians perform apart from the full band to support military and civilian ceremonial and diplomatic events.Their commitment to musical excellence has earned the respect of the foremost jazz artists from around the globe, leading to many collaborative performances and recordings with such luminaries as Dizzy Gillespie, Joe Williams, Sarah Vaughan and Doc Severinsen. In 1990, the Airmen of Note established the Jazz Heritage Series, featuring the \u201cNote\u201d in concert with legendary icons of jazz. The Jazz Heritage Series is broadcast to millions over National Public Radio, independent jazz radio stations, satellite radio services and the Internet. In addition, the \u201cNote\u201d produces and delivers recorded music to millions of fans worldwide through hundreds of media outlets. One of the group\u2019s holiday recordings, \u201cCool Yule,\u201d reached #2 on the JazzWeek jazz chart.As part of The U.S. Air Force Band, The Airmen of Note honors those who have served, inspires American citizens to heightened patriotism and service, and connects with\u00a0the global community on behalf of the U.S. Air Force and the United States. The excellence demonstrated by these Airmen musicians is a reflection of the excellence displayed by Airmen stationed around the globe. Each member is proud to represent all Airmen, whose selfless service and sacrifices ensure the freedoms we enjoy as citizens of the United States of America.\u00a0BASS TROMBONE\nMaster Sgt.

    "notes": "The Tallahassee Bach Parley performs music of the Baroque era (approx. 1600-1750) using period instruments. This recreates for our audiences the experience of hearing and seeing Baroque music as it may have been originally performed hundreds of years ago while generating a fresh sound immediately accessible to listeners today. The Bach Parley is made up of experienced musicians who are trained in historically informed performance, mainly local professional performers and teachers, and FSU faculty and students. Many Bach Parley musicians also perform in Baroque music groups around the country, such as in Atlanta, New York, Texas, and Boston.The word \u201cparley\u201d in French means discussion and a key element of Tallahassee Bach Parley concerts is the commentary offered by our music director to engage and enlighten our audience. These dialogues give the audience a historical background about the composers and their world and suggest what to listen for in the music. This entertaining and light-hearted educational commentary connects the audience with what the musicians are playing, lifts barriers between performers and listeners, and creates a relaxed concert atmosphere with an informed and engaged audience.Other programs include \u201cKids Go For B\u2019roque,\u201d a competition and honors concert featuring talented young musicians from the community performing the music of the Baroque period. We also run the Bach Parley String Academy and offer lessons on violin, viola, and cello as well as ukulele classes."

The TROCKS, as they are affectionately known, quickly garnered a major critical essay by Arlene Croce in The New Yorker, and combined with reviews in The New York Times and The Village Voice, established the Company as an artistic and popular success. By mid 1975, the TROCKS\u2019 inspired blend of their loving knowledge of dance, their comic approach, and the astounding fact that men can, indeed, dance en pointe without falling flat on their faces, was being noted beyond New York.

This recreates for our audiences the experience of hearing and seeing Baroque music as it may have been originally performed hundreds of years ago while generating a fresh sound immediately accessible to listeners today. The Bach Parley is made up of experienced musicians who are trained in historically informed performance, mainly local professional performers and teachers, and FSU faculty and students. Many Bach Parley musicians also perform in Baroque music groups around the country, such as in Atlanta, New York, Texas, and Boston.The word \u201cparley\u201d in French means discussion and a key element of Tallahassee Bach Parley concerts is the commentary offered by our music director to engage and enlighten our audience. These dialogues give the audience a historical background about the composers and their world and suggest what to listen for in the music. This entertaining and light-hearted educational commentary connects the audience with what the musicians are playing, lifts barriers between performers and listeners, and creates a relaxed concert atmosphere with an informed and engaged audience.Other programs include \u201cKids Go For B\u2019roque,\u201d a competition and honors concert featuring talented young musicians from the community performing the music of the Baroque period. We also run the Bach Parley String Academy and offer lessons on violin, viola, and cello as well as ukulele classes."

But these conventional measurements fall short when you\u2019re assessing the impact of The Beach Boys. This band has birthed a torrent of hit singles like \u201cSurfin\u2019,\u201d Good Vibrations\u201d and \u201cCalifornia Girls\u201d and sold albums by the tens of millions. But its greater significance lies in the fact that The Beach Boys changed the musical landscape so profoundly that every pop act since has been in its debt. The Beach Boys continue to create and perform with the same bold imagination and style that marked their explosive debut 40 years ago. Their Capitol Records release, Sounds of Summer, was double platinum with over two million in sales and climbing, marks a resurgence in Beach Boys interest that continues to rock the world.We are pleased to announce that each purchased ticket comes with a digital download of Mike Love\u2019s upcoming album,\u00a012 Sides of Summer.\u00a0You will receive an email from\u00a0officialCOMMUNITY,\u00a0on behalf of The Beach Boys, approximately two weeks after your ticket has been purchased.

These two best friends who met in high school music class have since released five albums and toured extensively across North America. Darlings of the Canadian music scene, Dala is bringing a fresh brand of acoustic pop music to the world. Drawing upon influences like The Beatles, Joni Mitchell, Neil Young and Bob Dylan, Dala writes songs that are both catchy and insightful. Amanda\u2019s ethereal soprano voice blends seamlessly with Sheila\u2019s velvety alto, creating the lush harmonies that have become their trademark. The sheer joy with which they perform is infectious, turning first-time listeners into instant fans. Dala is equally entertaining between songs, telling funny and down to earth stories that make every show unique. \u201cWe go to some emotional places in our music,\u201d Walther says, \u201cHumour serves as a relief from that, and a way to give the audience permission to laugh.\u201d \u201cThe more spontaneous the dialogue between songs,\u201d Carabine adds, \u201cthe better the performance and the more memorable the evening.\u201dPrevious Event ",

    "notes": "The Tallahassee Bach Parley performs music of the Baroque era (approx. 1600-1750) using period instruments. This recreates for our audiences the experience of hearing and seeing Baroque music as it may have been originally performed hundreds of years ago while generating a fresh sound immediately accessible to listeners today. The Bach Parley is made up of experienced musicians who are trained in historically informed performance, mainly local professional performers and teachers, and FSU faculty and students. Many Bach Parley musicians also perform in Baroque music groups around the country, such as in Atlanta, New York, Texas, and Boston.The word \u201cparley\u201d in French means discussion and a key element of Tallahassee Bach Parley concerts is the commentary offered by our music director to engage and enlighten our audience. These dialogues give the audience a historical background about the composers and their world and suggest what to listen for in the music. This entertaining and light-hearted educational commentary connects the audience with what the musicians are playing, lifts barriers between performers and listeners, and creates a relaxed concert atmosphere with an informed and engaged audience.Other programs include \u201cKids Go For B\u2019roque,\u201d a competition and honors concert featuring talented young musicians from the community performing the music of the Baroque period. We also run the Bach Parley String Academy and offer lessons on violin, viola, and cello as well as ukulele classes."

It is a classic American tale of rags to riches. From humble beginnings picking cotton in the fields to international stars that went on to sell 80 million albums while changing the face and sound of country music.\u00a0Quality songs that have become the soundtrack for American life are the foundation for ALABAMA\u2019s stellar career. Alabama introduced rock style guitars, lights, pyrotechnics and sounds to the country audience that has inspired many of today's brightest country stars including Kenny Chesney, Jason Aldean and Luke Bryan.\u00a0While their music continues to stand the test of time, their numbers and stats are beyond compare. 50 years since starting the band, Alabama has charted 43 #1 singles including 21 #1 singles in a row and have won over 179 CMA Awards, Grammy Awards, and ACM Awards. They are members of the Country Music Hall of Fame and have their own star of the Hollywood Walk of Fame. They are also world-class philanthropists who have raised over 250 Million dollars for charity. Celebrate 50 years of ALABAMA on their 50th Anniversary Tour coming to the Donald L. Tucker Civic Center\u00a0on October 10th."
