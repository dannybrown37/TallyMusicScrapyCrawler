Featuring chorus, soloists, and a full orchestra, this event will be a musical / spiritual gift of the season presented without charge by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and many of our friends."

Your legs will tone up very quickly. Clogging improves flexibility, coordination, endurance and strength. It increases lung capacity, relieves stress, and it\u2019s aerobic and burns fat. Clogging is usually danced in lines because there is a better social group feeling when you can see that your new friends are dancing the same routines as you. Some couple and partner routines are taught to keep in touch with the historic Appalachian clogging styles.The instructors teach both the steps and the routines. During classes the instructors cue or call all routines every time they are danced during the learning phase. This means once you know the steps at a given level, you can quickly join in with routines you have never seen.You will find you dance many and varied routines to pretty much all types of music, although country and top 100 current tunes are the most popular.Taps are a double jingle tap ordered from one of our suppliers. The sound of all the taps beating to the music, gets everybody tapping to the rhythms. In clogging the heel tap is used to give a strong regular beat during most steps.Like other worthwhile sporting activities, to progress quickly you may need to practice more than once a week at class. The good news is you can practice anywhere.",

Advance tickets will also be on sale electronically via Eventbrite and in person with NO FEES at\u00a0Finnegan\u2019s Wake\u00a0Irish Pub.After touring with Butch Trucks and the Freight Train, Melody Trucks immersed herself in the increasingly rich and diverse music scene in Jacksonville, Florida. The Melody Trucks Band came together in early 2017 as she encountered each member within this extended musical family. Their individual styles and influences run the entire span of every music genre: rock, blues, jazz, funk, classical, country, thrash metal, and even world music. This has culminated in fresh and unique interpretations of iconic songs from the genre of Melody\u2019s extended family.The members of the group have shared the stage with The Allman Brothers, Derek Trucks, Willie Nelson, Valor Trucks, Lee Boys, Butch Trucks and the Freight Train, Devon Allman, Duane Trucks, Bonnie Bramlett, Roosevelt Collier, John Popper, Bruce Katz, Ben Sparaco, JJ Grey and Mofro, and countless others.Support for this show will be The Bobby Lee Rodgers Jazz Trio, who takes one back to the Golden Decade when Jazz was the soul of the city. Along with playing his Jazz originals, during performances Bobby Lee Rodgers captures the sounds of the great artists of our time like Miles Davis, John Coltrane, Thelonious Monk and Wes Montgomery. He visits their compositions by putting his original vocabulary and sound into the harmonic structure of the songs.Bobby brings a unique sound to his performance because he plays through a combination of Leslie cabinet and vintage guitar amp which gives him the beautiful sound of an organ and guitar together. A stellar songwriter, vocalist and guitarist he fuses rock, funk, jazz and blues into a magical musical tapestry. He has performed with such great artists as Vassar Clements, Warren Haynes, Widespread Panic, George Porter Jr. and the list goes on and on. His new CD, BLR was just release to rave reviews. Whether playing his originals or capturing sound of the jazz culture, Bobby Lee Rodgers can truly be called one of the new modern day guitar greats.Learn More About the Artist:THE MELODY TRUCKS BAND: Official Website\u00a0|\u00a0Facebook\u00a0|\u00a0InstagramTHE BOBBY LEE RODGERS TRIO: Official Website\u00a0|\u00a0Facebook\u00a0| Youtube",

No refunds or exchanges of ticket purchases. Advance tickets will also be on sale electronically at this link:\nhttps://850tix.com/events/themelodytrucksband and in person with NO FEES at Finnegan\u2019s Wake Irish Pub.After touring with Butch Trucks and the Freight Train, Melody Trucks immersed herself in the increasingly rich and diverse music scene in Jacksonville, Florida. The Melody Trucks Band came together in early 2017 as she encountered each member within this extended musical family. Their individual styles and influences run the entire span of every music genre: rock, blues, jazz, funk, classical, country, thrash metal, and even world music. This has culminated in fresh and unique interpretations of iconic songs from the genre of Melody\u2019s extended family.The members of the group have shared the stage with The Allman Brothers, Derek Trucks, Willie Nelson, Valor Trucks, Lee Boys, Butch Trucks and the Freight Train, Devon Allman, Duane Trucks, Bonnie Bramlett, Roosevelt Collier, John Popper, Bruce Katz, Ben Sparaco, JJ Grey and Mofro, and countless others.Support for this show will be The Bobby Lee Rodgers Jazz Trio, who takes one back to the Golden Decade when Jazz was the soul of the city. Along with playing his Jazz originals, during performances Bobby Lee Rodgers captures the sounds of the great artists of our time like Miles Davis, John Coltrane, Thelonious Monk and Wes Montgomery. He visits their compositions by putting his original vocabulary and sound into the harmonic structure of the songs.Bobby brings a unique sound to his performance because he plays through a combination of Leslie cabinet and vintage guitar amp which gives him the beautiful sound of an organ and guitar together. A stellar songwriter, vocalist and guitarist he fuses rock, funk, jazz and blues into a magical musical tapestry. He has performed with such great artists as Vassar Clements, Warren Haynes, Widespread Panic, George Porter Jr. and the list goes on and on. His new CD, BLR was just release to rave reviews. Whether playing his originals or capturing sound of the jazz culture, Bobby Lee Rodgers can truly be called one of the new modern day guitar greats.Learn More About the Artist:THE MELODY TRUCKS BAND:\u00a0Official Website\u00a0|\u00a0Facebook\u00a0|\u00a0InstagramTHE BOBBY LEE RODGERS TRIO:\u00a0Official Website\u00a0|\u00a0Facebook\u00a0|\u00a0Youtube"

This resulted in a rise in exposure, to the point where he was invited to become the resident mix show DJ on Northern Ireland\u2019s number one-rated commercial radio station Cool FM. The station\u2019s Hiphop show, \u2018The Extended Weekend\u2019 was, at the time, the only urban show in the country.He can now be found behind the turntables at various radio stations across the United States, from New York City all the way down to Tallahassee, FL.\u00a0Dubbed \u2018The Deepest Crates in the 850\u2019 (Tallahassee\u2019s area code) he has an expansive library of music over multiple genres.

As of 2018 Gales has recorded seventeen albums for major record labels and has done session and tribute work. He has also contributed vocals on several records by the Memphis rap groups Prophet Posse and Three 6 Mafia under the name Lil E. Gales picked up the guitar at age four and was playing in blues competitions by the age of 10. Although Gales plays a right-handed guitar \"upside-down\" (with the bass E string on the bottom), he is not naturally left-handed; he was taught by his brother, who is left-handed, and never second-guessed the untraditional technique. This will be an all-seating show with the exception of bar and overflow areas only."

By the end of the upbeat Latin-themed opening number, 38 days have passed, and the birds are a little tired of cruising. The Counting Crows have lost count, the Mockingbird is getting on everyone\\\u2019s nerves, and no one has heard from the wise old owl. Even Red Robin Williams, the resident stand-up comic, finds his jokes falling flat.A Bat, traumatized by being forced to live with the mammals (lions and tigers and bears!) then tries to sneak into the bird sanctuary. The Dove, a kind-hearted bird with dreams of being a great explorer, immediately befriends the Bat, but the Raven calls him a \u201cfreak.\u201dUnder the Rainbow explores, through the magic of musical theatre, what it means to be different \u2014 and how our differences make us all stronger and more beautiful, both individually and as a group.\u00a0With appearances from Katy Parrot, the resident pop star, and\u00a0Blue Jay Z, along with the rap stylings of the Angry Birds, these avian adventurers learn, by the time this story is over,\u00a0that \u201cThe Sky Is the Limit,\u201d and their adventure has just begun."

These autism friendly performances give audiences the freedom to express themselves and react openly while watching the dancers and hearing the music. Sensory stimuli such as lights and sound are modified and the theater designates quiet spaces to take a break. A Parsons Dance representative navigates the audience through the performance, pausing between each piece to tell the audience what to look for and to answer questions. This ensures that the performance moves at an accessible pace and makes it interactive, engaging, and comfortable for all audiences.Previous Event Next Event",

    "notes": "In 2012, Izzard was a college dropout living in Orlando, pursuing music full time. The release of the debut single \u201cHole in One\u201d solidified him as an authentic indie-blues artist, earning a loyal underground following. He continued to study the roots of blues and soul music, reinventing his style and reemerging as N.W. Izzard.In 2015, N.W. reconnected with hometown friend Tyler Watts, who was on the tail end of producing an adventure travel documentary, where Izzard was a featured artist on the soundtrack. Sharing a common vision, they began exchanging original songs and ideas while listening to their favorite blues records. In a few days time, songs like Howlin\u2019 Out, Sun\u2019s Gonna Shine and Down to Ride were born. Izzard introduced Watts to the art of busking, performing in the streets of North Central Florida before moving aboard Tyler\u2019s 46\u2019 sailboat and relocating to the Florida Keys. The duo spent the remainder of 2015 writing songs, playing the streets and refining their sound.During that time, another childhood friend, Nathan Ranew, saw the N.W. Izzard duo performing at a music festival and convinced the boys to move to Jax Beach, where there was more opportunities for original music. In 2016, they \u201chit the ground running\u201d earning residencies at Lynch\u2019s Irish Pub and other local venues, playing memorable performances at the infamous Freebird Live and continuing to build their cult-like following. Upon the release of their debut album \u201cNo Sleep\u201d, the band was evolving from a 2 piece into a power trio as Nate transitioned from manger to bass player, and from local stand outs to regional touring artists. The new addition brought forward a new sound and subsequently a new name, The Honey Hounds were born.Following the 2017 release of their EP \u201cMidnight Magic\u201d, the Honey Hounds continue to reenergize western music, embodying the rock n roll lifestyle while embracing the roots of soul and funk. Balancing between righteousness and the mysticism that surrounds the blues culture, they\u2019ve come to represent the resurgence of a genre and the voice of a generation.Currently the boys are touring and playing festivals though out the U.S. and preparing to record their next album.Learn More About the Artist:HONEY HOUNDS: Official Website |\u00a0Facebook\u00a0| Instagram | Spotify",

But she knew there were songs, and they had to get out. Six even years since her critically acclaimed Welder, as well as much personal tumult, there were songs that needed to be born.For fans of the Florida-born\u2019n\u2019raised Cook, a Grand Ole Opry regular, SiriusXM Outlaw Country hostess and David Letterman favorite,\u00a0Exodus of Venus\u00a0will be something of a shock. If she maintains the tang of her drawl, what emerges \u2013 beyond Cook\u2019s always vibrant and vivid sense of detail \u2013 is a song cycle soaked in turpentine, musk and honey.Make sure you don\u2019t miss her long awaited return to our Mainstage on Friday, January 25th.Learn More About the Artist:ELIZABETH COOK:\u00a0Official Website\u00a0|\u00a0Facebook\u00a0|\u00a0Soundcloud\u00a0|\u00a0Instagram\u00a0|\u00a0Twitter"

    "notes": "Since 2008 the Bach Parley has been performing primarily on period instruments, that is, harpsichord and baroque style stringed instruments with gut strings. The group focuses on music of Johann Sebastian Bach, his contemporaries, as well as pieces written before J. S. Bach was born with music written in the years 1600-1750.Performing on period-style instruments, the Bach Parley offers unique, exceptional concert experiences to educate and engage our community. We present Baroque music as it was performed hundreds of years ago with a fresh, accessible sound for today\u2019s audiences. The French word \u201cparley\u201d means discussion and a key element of Bach Parley concerts is the commentary provided by Music Director Valerie Arsenault who gives historical context about the composers and offers suggestions about what to listen for in the music.The Tallahassee Bach Parley is also the umbrella organization for a non-profit music school. In 2015, four teachers united to teach violin, viola, and cello at the Bach Parley String Academy at St. John\u2019s Episcopal church, and now the Academy has grown to six teachers, almost 100 students, and even offers ukulele classes.At all Sunday Tallahassee Bach Parley concerts this season, patrons will receive an insert in their programs with a discount coupon to use after the concert at participating downtown area restaurants. A $10 donation is suggested, and free childcare will be offered. The Bach Parley will hold their annual membership reception after the concert.For additional information about the Tallahassee Bach Parley, including the Bach Parley String Academy music school, visit www.bachparley.org.Enjoy the music, the venue, and the magic of Baroque performance with the Tallahassee Bach Parley!"

And while that record may have come to many as a surprise,\u00a0Years\u00a0solidifies the point: Sarah Shook & the Disarmers have moved from getting people\u2019s attention to commanding it.

It\u2019s about picking yourself up and dusting yourself off after years of being trampled and beaten down, jutting your chin out, head high, after they\u2019ve done their worst, and saying, \u201cStill here.\u201dThis record is shouting \u201cf**k you, I do want I want\u201d from the rooftops to the mother******g cosmos.\u201dLearn More About the Artist:Sarah Shook & The Disarmers:\u00a0Official Website\u00a0|\u00a0Facebook\u00a0|\u00a0Youtube\u00a0|\u00a0Instagram\u00a0|\u00a0Twitter"

    "notes": "For centuries scientists and engineers have worked within the limitations of the natural world to expand the palette on which musicians can create. This symbiotic relationship is not always widely appreciated, and is symptomatic of much more fundamental connections between science and art that extend into many arenas. Both science and art are driven by intuition and creativity, and both allow genius to express itself in the context of artificial or natural \u201crules\u201d. Understanding the physical nature of music illuminates the beauty of this creative process. Music, science and engineering are connected at many levels. I will use live keyboard demonstrations to illuminate how the origin of some musical styles, particularly blues piano, can be found in fundamental properties of sound and music. In particular, I will focus on the evolution of the scale and its impact on harmony and melody in western music.Murray Gibson became the Dean of the FAMU-FSU College of Engineering in 2016. \u00a0He grew up in the United Kingdom and holds a PhD in Physics from the University of Cambridge. He has a long career in industry and academia and has been Head of the Electronics and Photonics Materials Research Department at Bell Laboratories, \u00a0Associate Director of the Argonne National Laboratory, Professor at the University of Illinois in Urbana Champaign, and Founding Dean of the College of Science at Northeastern University.

The group focuses on music of Johann Sebastian Bach, his contemporaries, as well as pieces written before J. S. Bach was born with music written in the years 1600-1750.Performing on period-style instruments, the Bach Parley offers unique, exceptional concert experiences to educate and engage our community. We present Baroque music as it was performed hundreds of years ago with a fresh, accessible sound for today\u2019s audiences. The French word \u201cparley\u201d means discussion and a key element of Bach Parley concerts is the commentary provided by Music Director Valerie Arsenault who gives historical context about the composers and offers suggestions about what to listen for in the music.The Tallahassee Bach Parley is also the umbrella organization for a non-profit music school. In 2015, four teachers united to teach violin, viola, and cello at the Bach Parley String Academy at St. John\u2019s Episcopal church, and now the Academy has grown to six teachers, almost 100 students, and even offers ukulele classes.At all Sunday Tallahassee Bach Parley concerts this season, patrons will receive an insert in their programs with a discount coupon to use after the concert at participating downtown area restaurants. A $10 donation is suggested, and free childcare will be offered. The Bach Parley will hold their annual membership reception after the concert.For additional information about the Tallahassee Bach Parley, including the Bach Parley String Academy music school, visit www.bachparley.org.Enjoy the music, the venue, and the magic of Baroque performance with the Tallahassee Bach Parley!Don\u2019t miss our annual membership reception after the concert\u2026"
